"BAGHDAD  —   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market  killing at least 36 people hours after President François Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers  a police officer said  adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande  Haider   Iraq’s prime minister  said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around  he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State  also known as ISIS or ISIL  claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad  underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year  including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City  a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003   invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit  vegetables and laborers’ shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim  28  an owner of a nearby cellphone store  described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomber’s vehicle  trying to get hired. “Then a big boom came  sending them up into the air ” said Mr. Hashim  who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed “the most ineffective security forces in the world” for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government  even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month  the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capital’s six million residents. “We have no idea who will kill at any moment and who’s supposed to protect us ” said Ali Abbas  a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. “If the securities forces can’t protect us  then allow us to do the job. ” Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70  according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately  the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a “  incident ” without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum  and later traveled to the   northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul "SYDNEY  Australia  —   The annual beach pilgrimage during the height of summer in Melbourne  Australia’s   city  is threatened by an unsettling phenomenon: shores where the tides are tainted with excrement. The Environment Protection Authority in the state of Victoria said on Monday that heavy rains had caused fecal pollution to wash into Port Phillip from rivers  creeks and drains. It advised against swimming at 21 beaches because of poor water quality. “It’s poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem ” said Anthony Boxshall  the agency’s manager of applied sciences  noting that the waste was coming from people  dogs  horses  cows  birds and other animals. Fecal pollution can cause serious health problems  including gastroenteritis. Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the   Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip  affecting the city’s bayside beaches the most. The agency  which takes regular water samples  rates beaches. A “good” rating means that the water is suitable for swimming. “Fair” means that rainfall has affected the water. “Poor” means people should avoid it. Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual. “When the temperature gets above 86 Fahrenheit  Melbournians typically pack the family in the car with food and drink and spend the day at the beach ” said Sam Riley  who lives in the city. “I was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer 1.0 "When the Green Bay Packers lost to the Washington Redskins in Week 11  dropping to   Aaron Rodgers vowed to “run the table” in a march to the playoffs. With a   victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night  the team fulfilled Rodgers’ promise. Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants  thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams  but the N. F. C. North bragging rights  and a home game in the first round of the playoffs  were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the team’s sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit. Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams. But when all was said and done  ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order. No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time: 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The Seahawks’ title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg. After the injury  the Seahawks went   with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the   Rams and 49ers. That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions  who lost their final three games  blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay. Line: Seahawks   ( : 43) No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay Packers Time: 4:40 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East  home of the   Dallas Cowboys  the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the   record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a   Packers squad that won its final six games. The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs  they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times. Line: Packers   ( : 44. 5) Bye weeks: Dallas  Atlanta No. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston Texans Time: 4:35 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line: Texans   ( : 37) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. ’s division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage  whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler  was forced to leave Week 17’s loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds  it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16  Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17  and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston. No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time: 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the team’s quarterback  Ryan Tannehill  was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore  and Jay Ajayi  the team’s   running back  they won two of three games and secured a   berth. But going up against a   offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for Miami’s middling defense  even if Tannehill’s knee heals enough to allow him to return. Line: Steelers  .5 ( : 47. 5) Bye weeks: New England  Kansas City With four teams vying for two N. F. C. playoff spots  all eyes were on the   game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings  with the Lions and Packers playing a     evening matchup. The Giants  who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain  threw a wrench in the Redskins’ plans  eliminating their division rivals with a decisive   victory. With the drama essentially taken out of the N. F. C. all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A. F. C. where there was a   at the top of the standings in the A. F. C. West. Just a week after losing Derek Carr  the team’s quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player  to a broken leg  the Oakland Raiders were crushed   by the Denver Broncos. That  combined with the Kansas City Chiefs’   victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a   spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. which comes with a   bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders  who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a   team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a   quarterback under center as Carr’s backup  Matt McGloin  injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos. Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No.   in the A. F. C. it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A. F. C. with a win over Miami  the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N. F. C. before their loss to Philadelphia  and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N. F. C. with a   win over New Orleans. The only remaining chance for a minor   was for the Packers  who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker  to lose to the Lions  which would have forced them to play on the road in the   round of the playoffs. But the    aspect of the de facto N. F. C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants  which eliminated the Redskins from   contention. While most of the races were straight forward  one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers  having the Redskins tie the Giants  the Packers lose to the Lions  and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis  Dallas  Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day "Mariah Carey suffered through a performance train wreck in Times Square on New Year’s Eve as malfunctions left her at a loss vocally during her hit song “Emotions ” struggling to reach notes and to sync the lyrics and music. The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her   numbers  “We Belong Together ” while a recording of the song continued to play  a confirmation that she had been  . But on Sunday  a dispute erupted between Ms. Carey’s representatives and producers of ABC’s “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest ” on which the singer was performing. Ms. Carey’s manager  Stella Bulochnikov  charged that the show’s producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them  —   and chose to continue showing Ms. Carey’s messy performance “to get ratings. ” “I will never know the truth  but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production ” Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday. “I’m certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate. It is what it is: New Year’s Eve in Times Square. Mariah did them a favor. She was the biggest star there  and they did not have their” act together. Dick Clark Productions  which produced the show  issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Carey’s performance woes had nothing to do with the production  and that any suggestion that the company “would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory  outrageous and frankly absurd. ” “In very rare instances  there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television ” the statement said  adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company “had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey’s New Year’s Eve performance. ” A veteran audio producer  Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International  a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years  also said in an email that there had been no malfunctions with the sound equipment he oversaw. “Every monitor and   device worked perfectly ” Mr. Goldstein said. “ I can’t comment beyond that and don’t know what her nontechnical issue may have been. ” A spokeswoman for Ms. Carey said on Sunday that the singer was not at fault for her performance. “Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances ” the spokeswoman  Nicole Perna  told The Associated Press. It was a rare meltdown on national television by one of the   recording artists of all time. Ms. Carey  a pop phenomenon in the 1990s who won five Grammys out of 34 nominations over the years  was the final   act on ABC’s “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest. ” She had just finished “Auld Lang Syne” when her star turn began to spiral out of control. “We can’t hear ” she said in the opening seconds of “Emotions” after she sashayed down the stage before more than one million people who had gathered to watch the ball drop in Manhattan. Standing still with her left hand on her hip while music played  Ms. Carey told the audience that there had not been a proper sound check before her performance. Then she said  “We’ll just sing ” and noted proudly of her song  “It went to No. 1. ” But she could not manage the notes that followed  and she either forgot lyrics or did not want to deliver a subpar performance. “We’re missing some of these vocals  but it is what it is ” she said. “Let the audience sing. ” ABC quickly cut to shots of the Times Square crowd as Ms. Carey tried to perform some of her choreography. She continued suggesting fixes from the stage  and at one point seemed to defend herself. “I’m trying to be a good sport here ” she said. When the number ended  the crowd cheered her on. “That was  —   ” she said  pausing for effect  “amazing. ” She seemed to recover at first with “We Belong Together ” but there appeared to be another malfunction  and Ms. Carey again stopped singing. But this time  the prerecorded number kept playing. “It just don’t get any better ” she said  and then left the stage. The cause of the problem was not immediately clear. After the performance  Ms. Carey posted a mildly profane slang phrase on Twitter with an “upset” emoji 1.0 "PARIS  —   When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March  Yves Ubelmann got a call from Syria’s director of antiquities to come over in a hurry. An architect by training  Mr. Ubelmann  36  had worked in Syria before the country was engulfed by war. But now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects  mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in Paris: producing digital copies of threatened historical sites. Palmyra  parts of it already destroyed by the Islamists who deemed these monuments idolatrous  was still rigged with explosives. So he and Houmam Saad  his Syrian colleague  spent four days flying a drone with a robot camera over the crumbled arches and temples. “Drones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details  every crack and hole  and we can take very precise measurements ” said Mr. Ubelmann  who founded the company Iconem. “This is the stuff architects and archaeologists need. ” They need it in a new push for virtual preservation that scientists  archaeologists and others  like Mr. Ubelmann  are compiling on a large scale. The records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored  repaired or reconstructed. Of special interest today are ancient sites in Syria  and also Iraq  that have suffered from war  looting and the Islamic State. “Palmyra was very difficult ” Mr. Ubelmann said. “The terrorists were uploading videos with them blowing up monuments and smashing statues to manipulate public opinion ” he said. “We felt the best response was to magnify the pictures of these places and show their splendor and their importance to the culture. It became a war of images. ” The latest front in that war is in the exhibition halls of the Grand Palais in Paris  where  through Jan. 9  many of the 40  000 images he and his team took at Palmyra have become the basis for displays. Called “Eternal Sites: From Bamiyan to Palmyra ” the show aims to draw attention to the rising threats to global heritage. To underscore the exhibition’s political importance  it was opened several weeks ago by President François Hollande of France  who described it as “an act of resistance” against terror and intolerance. Showing the beauty of the Middle Eastern heritage  he said  “is the best answer to the Islamist propaganda of hate  destruction and death. ”   Martinez  the director of the Louvre and the lead curator of the show  said the sites had been chosen because “all are under threat from pillaging  neglect or destruction and are not accessible to the public. ” He said it aimed to mobilize public opinion “in the face of the devastation of unique heritage. ” Besides images from Palmyra  the multimedia show projects enormous   photographs and videos  immersing visitors in different eras  including the ancient Iraqi city of Khorsabad around 700 B. C. an   mosque in Damascus and a medieval Christian citadel. Mr. Ubelmann dismissed any criticism of collaboration with the government of the Syrian president  Bashar  . “We were working pro bono  not for any government  but to help the archaeologists ” he said. They shared their work with the Syrian archaeologists  he said  adding  “We also train our colleagues so they can later do this on their own. ” What is paramount is memory and potential restoration. In the last year  his team has flown drones over some 20 historic sites in Syria. Recently  it moved into   zones in Iraq  close to the front line in the fight against the Islamic State. The team is now analyzing the war’s effects on the remains of once thriving cities dating back some 3  000 years  including Nineveh  Khorsabad and the thrashed temple and palace of Nimrud  where the government drove out the jihadists in November. In 2015  Islamists sent out videos showing militants using sledgehammers to break reliefs of human figures and mythical winged bulls as part of their   campaign. “Nimrud was probably the most splendid of the Assyrian cities ” Layla Abdulkarim  a Syrian architect  said as she analyzed aerial photographs. Using drones in archaeological work is not entirely new  specialists say  but at a recent gathering in Paris researchers from Europe and the Middle East said they were now having to practice “war archaeology ” that is  collecting reliable data from   areas. The images from the drones in war zones had proved immensely valuable. But these were barely scratching the surface. Before the war  close to 150 archaeological projects were underway  just in Syria  researchers said. Experts from many countries are trying to assess the damage in Syria’s old cities but also in the area where the Islamic State held sway that is straddling Iraq and Syria  the region that is seen as central to human history and often called the birthplace of modern economics and writing. There is an outcry for data about the havoc wreaked in Yemen by Saudi bombing. “People are exchanging satellite images and data on blogs and other research platforms  but we have no real assessment yet because so many ancient sites are not accessible ” said Pascal Butterlin  a professor of archaeology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Time is of the essence  even in the case of    ruins  Mr. Butterlin said. He has led expeditions for more than 20 years to Mari  near Syria’s border with Iraq. Before fleeing  the guards at Mari reported that looters had come from Iraq  he said. “We need to know what places need to be stabilized and how looters have altered the sites ” he said. “Important evidence  like clandestine pits  can disappear very quickly through sandstorms and erosion. ” Cheikhmous Ali  a Syrian archaeologist based in France  who founded the international group the Association for the Protection of Syrian Archaeology  said reports of organized pillaging continued. A first wave of looting began in 2012  Mr. Ali said  and looting has accelerated since 2014 with the arrival of the Islamic State. While jihadists were more motivated to destroy the artifacts  they had also allowed looters to operate in exchange for money. Mr. Ali said he kept an ever changing tally of museums bombed  objects carted off  safes stolen. The exhibition in Paris  which is drawing large crowds  coincides with “History Begins in Mesopotamia ” a show at the Louvre’s regional museum in Lens. Both exhibitions highlight the French government’s active concern about cultural damage in Syria  which was briefly controlled by France in the first half of the 20th century. Mr. Hollande has taken a strong interest  condemning the deliberate destruction of patrimony by all sides as “war crimes. ” This past month  France offered $30 million toward a proposed $100 million fund to protect sites as fighting abates  provide emergency storage for artifacts and eventually rehabilitate monuments. At the “Eternal Sites” opening at the Grand Palais  Mr. Hollande stressed that France was taking in more Syrian refugees trying to protect monuments of great historical and cultural importance did not mean ignoring the suffering of the population. “Should we be concerned about the patrimony?” he asked. “What is more important  saving lives or saving stones? In reality "Pop music and fashion never met cuter than in George Michael’s “Freedom! ’90” video. Sure  other catwalk favorites starred in music videos during that era  and fashion photographers like Steven Meisel and Herb Ritts were recruited by stars such as Madonna  Chris Isaak and Janet Jackson to burnish their visuals. But the convergence of a   maker’s irresistible rhythms and lyrics  a group of models at the peak of their fame and a director on the verge of his own runaway success gave “Freedom! ’90” a jolt of stylish energy that has yet to fade after more than a  . Directed by David Fincher  who was at the start of his film career  and filmed over several days at Merton Park Studios in London  the video from Mr. Michael’s 1990 album  “Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 ” brought together five models  —   Naomi Campbell  Linda Evangelista  Christy Turlington  Cindy Crawford and Tatjana Patitz  —   who were then the queens of fashion. It runs for six and a half minutes  and its production also gathered a team of novice professionals who would go on to become major forces in fashion  including the stylist Camilla Nickerson  the hairdresser Guido Palau  the makeup artist Carol Brown and the model John Pearson. Shot in moody  romantic   tones  “Freedom! ’90” had been viewed more than 37 million times on YouTube by the time of Mr. Michael’s unexpected death at 53 last Sunday. Reached by phone this week  some of the participants recalled their experiences on set  and some of the video’s most ardent fans reflected on its impact. Naomi Campbell  model. We’d done a British Vogue cover with Peter Lindbergh with all of us. I met George in L. A. and he said: “I’ve been told that I need to speak to you to get the girls for the video. What would it take to get you?” We were living in America  so I said you’d have to fly us in  basically. I said yes  and then Christy and Tatjana and everyone came in. The night before the video  I didn’t sleep at all  because we did five shows for Thierry Mugler in Paris. He had 76 models  and it was the big finale of him designing  although none of us knew that then. The last show finished at around 3 o’clock in the morning  and George was there. So from there I went back to my hotel  packed my bags and went on the first flight to London. David Fincher knew exactly what he wanted. He didn’t really give us parts  but he knew exactly which part of the song he wanted each and every one of us to sing. I was more the active one. Cindy was sultry. I don’t think any of us knew what it would become. We knew the song was a hit  but we didn’t know in any way what effect it would have in terms of videos  the way it would affect people. We were all really excited on the day it was going to be aired. They all had great premieres back in the day. They don’t have them anymore. Not that I’ve seen. MTV’s changed. Hasn’t it? I got to see George a little bit more after that because Kate Moss was neighbors with him. When we did the Olympics  he sang there in London. We all did the finale  and he was rehearsing and Kate and I went to watch him with this amazing choir singing “Freedom. ” After  he invited us all back to his home and he had this really nice   in the garden  and we all got to light these wishing lanterns and we all did that together. That’s the memory I’m going to keep. Guido Palau  hairdresser. I don’t know how I got the job. George Michael and David Fincher had seen some of my work in British Vogue. It was a different time then. It was a big  big production  a   video because they had to bring in all the girls. Every girl had a day  though Christy and Linda were there together. My part was to make the girls the best they could look as who they were. They weren’t playing characters. They were playing themselves. And each had their own personality: Linda the comedian  Christy much more classic  Cindy the pinup  Tatjana this kind of film noir  and Naomi a very strong kind of woman. We extracted that from them. They weren’t prodded at all  though there were some surprises  like Linda’s hair  which she’d done for a job for someone else. It wasn’t like I said  “Oh  dye your hair blond ” not at all. At the time  we really didn’t realize how iconic the video would become. I was probably a bit naïve about the whole thing seeing how it was a bit of a   job for me. What I remember most is the days being very long  and at the end of the day  the red wine would come out. There we’d be in the location van drinking and singing with George. Tatjana Patitz  model. I was in my own zone. I had to kind of slide up and down the wall for part of the day. The feel of the set was so   this big  loft kind of vibe. There was another setup with me laying on a chaise longue with a black smoking jacket. I think I may have had a bustier on. And I was smoking  even. People still smoked in videos then and even in films. George Michael wasn’t on the set the day I was there  but I’d met him a few times in L. A. Herb Ritts shot a cover of me and him for a magazine  —   I’m trying to remember what magazine it was. So many magazines have come and gone. Glamour was very present in fashion in those days  feminine glamour  people looking at inspiration from the movie stars of the ’40s and ’50s  —   Audrey Hepburn  Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner. A lot of magazines were pairing models with pop stars or movie stars to shoot covers. It was very different those days. The business was much smaller and wasn’t as saturated  not as fast as it is now. Models were known by their first names  and suddenly the glamour we embodied at that time crossed over to pop music videos and film. We were part of the entertainment industry  which made it really fun. George was very nice  almost a little shy. Maybe that’s the wrong word. He was mellow and kind. I was quite   at the time because I grew up with Wham and their music he was one of my first teenage crushes. In the five or so times I met him  he was always very pleasant and sweet but timid  not one of those vivacious    people who take a room by storm. I remember the shoot being in fall or early winter. I flew in on the Concorde for the day and flew back to New York right after that. It’s funny. A lot of people were using models in videos then  but this one in particular stood the test of time. It’s not like you look at “Freedom! ’90” now and say  “Oh  my God  it’s so ’80s!” It’s not like “Working Girl. ” John Pearson  model. My agent called up and said: “Hey  do you want to do this video? All the big girls are doing it. ’” Of course I said yes. I was a big George Michael fan. I used to see him all the time in London at the clubs. I arrived at the studios at 3 o’clock in the afternoon and met David Fincher briefly  and then basically sat around all day and watched while Christy and Linda were being shot. There’s one shot where Linda puts her head underneath her sweater that’s amazing. That wasn’t rehearsed. Linda really knows how to use her body to communicate in an elegant way  never cheap and tawdry. George was there  very warm and nice but very shy. The day went long  and the producer said at the end of the day  “Can we shoot you tomorrow?” I didn’t have another job booked  so I said  “Sure. ” Then he said  “Do you mind doing it for nothing?” I said  “No way. ” It was a little bit bolshie of me  but I knew what the girls were getting. In the end  I was paid $15  000 for the day  which is not bad to hang out with these fabulous  beautiful girls. But I’d been working nonstop for three years  and I wasn’t going to do it for free. And it turned out to be one of those fabulously easy     jobs  everyone riding on this wave of semistardom and recognition for the models. I really didn’t realize how big it all was at the time. Candis Cayne  actress  model and former drag personality. There was a group of girls in N. Y. C. in the ’90s  and we didn’t want to model ourselves on anything other than the supermodels. Linda and Naomi and Christy. So when the video of “Freedom!” came out and they were all in it  we were obsessed. I used to do shows at Boy Bar  so I decided I was going to do “Freedom!” and got Lina and Mistress Formika and Sherry Vine to play the various parts. I was Linda. She was my favorite. We did the whole thing naked under white sheets. After the very last chorus  we dropped the sheets and were completely naked holding our groin areas. That song meant a lot to us. There were singers we knew were gay then  but no one really talked about it. We just grabbed onto songs and artists who knew who and what we were  whether it was Madonna with “Vogue” and “Truth or Dare” or George Michael with “Freedom!” I don’t know if he was openly gay or not  then. I guess not. But it was almost O. K. because we all knew and it was such a homophobic time. It was so oppressive  particularly when you factor in the AIDS epidemic. To be open would have been a career killer. But going to a club  listening to “Freedom!  ” it was an escape. Alan Hunter  one of the original MTV V. J. s. It was a funny moment in my life. I was driving my kid to day care on a day where I didn’t know where my career had gone. I’d left MTV. My agent wasn’t calling. I was depressed. And I turned on the radio  and on came George Michael’s new song. It was George Michael at the peak of his writing skills. It was such a brilliant   capstone I’d ever heard. It was his    song. He was saying  “Everything that brought me to pop stardom I now disavow. ” Then I saw the video shortly thereafter with all that iconography he’d used in his past  and he literally sets those things on fire and explodes them. The leather jacket he’d worn and the jukebox from “Faith. ” And he just steps away. He wasn’t even in the video. It showed how serious he was  even while he said it all with a lot of love. It was such a joyous song. I actually felt happy. Zac Posen  fashion designer. I was 10 years old  10 or 11. I’d see it in my living room waiting for Madonna to come on. I probably wanted to be the child in “Open Your Heart. ” But what I remember about “Freedom!” was that it was kind of a seminal predecessor to grunge. Because you have these incredibly glamorous beauties in a very industrial  Corinne Day    space. There’s water dripping down the walls and George Michael’s leather jacket is on fire 1.0 "WASHINGTON  —   The most powerful and ambitious   Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday  with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life  —   refashioning the country’s social safety net  wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration. Even before   Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20  giving their party full control of the government  Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities  —   most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act’s repeal. Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation. Also up early: filling a   Supreme Court seat  which is sure to set off a pitched showdown  and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees. “It’s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results ” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader. “And we intend to do it. ” But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals  Democrats are preparing roadblocks. The party’s brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference  Mr. Trump’s   cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts. (On Saturday  he offered New Year’s wishes “to all ” including “those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. ”) Obstacles will also come from Republicans  who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals  like vast changes to Medicare  that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. For Republicans  the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved  —   the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the  . Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda  only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader  Bob Dole  who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. “They’ve been given a golden opportunity here ” said Trent Lott  the former Republican Senate majority leader. “But I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House  and the danger is overplaying your hand. “If you go too far  like what happened with Obamacare  and you get no support at all from the other side  you have a problem ” Mr. Lott continued. “You have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. ” The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still  both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner  despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump’s chief of staff  Reince Priebus. The Senate may be narrowly divided  but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support  at least some of the time. But on many issues  Senate Democrats  —   including their new leader  Chuck Schumer of New York  —   are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting  using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trump’s agenda. “After campaigning on a promise to help the middle class    Trump’s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he’s sworn in ” said Senator Patty Murray  Democrat of Washington. “Democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. ” Republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules  many   that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process  and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone. “I hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else ” the House speaker  Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin  said at a recent forum. “I think if we can provide regulatory relief right away  that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. ” In late December  the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. That regulation  one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse  is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. But Congress is likely to block it  using the obscure Congressional Review Act  which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules’ completion. Given time constraints on the Senate floor  members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases  another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources  and still others that restrict pesticide use. Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year  —   already a quarter over  —   that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster. But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama’s  and they may delay the repeal measure’s effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump’s cabinet picks  and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However  they cannot do much more than that  because when they were in charge  they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously  such nominations could face a filibuster  which required 60 votes to overcome. Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump’s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama  whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general  has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because  she said  her schedule got too busy. “The senator doesn’t want to rush ” said her spokesman  Tom Mentzer. One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell’s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats  —   and some Republicans  who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him  —   want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration  which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking  will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation  the party’s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. “This is no time for hubris "WASHINGTON  —   It’s   or   time for Republicans. After a tumultuous decade that has seen profound changes in the makeup and character of their party  Republicans are poised to complete their slow but steady climb back to power as they seize control of the House  Senate and the White House for the first time since 2006. That political triad will leave them with a splendid opportunity for success. But there is little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nation’s health care delivery system  restructure the tax code  drive job creation  muscle up American foreign policy  rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set America on a new course. Republicans who will take command of the Senate and House as the 115th Congress convenes on Tuesday have long been itching for a chance to do it their way  constantly grousing that President Obama and Congressional Democrats held back American progress and economic growth. Now they must show they can deliver. And they know it. “When you have both houses and the presidency  there is no acceptable excuse for not passing major legislation ” said Representative Tom Cole  a senior Republican from Oklahoma. “There is a lot of pressure on Republican members to produce and to produce quickly. ” That will not be easy. There is a mutual wariness between many Republicans in Congress and   Donald J. Trump  leaving it unclear how often their interests and priorities will coalesce or collide. Some of the biggest fights might well be between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House occupied by a man who campaigned against the establishment and some of the very Republicans running Congress. Republicans must also maneuver while facing slightly expanded Democratic minorities in the House and Senate  in a climate that is  in many respects  even more hostile than it was before the November elections. Democrats remain angry at how Republicans treated President Obama  including their refusal to consider the nomination of federal Judge Merrick B. Garland to the United States Supreme Court. Democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to Mr. Garland’s nomination to satisfy themselves and to show their supporters that they are not going to roll over for the new Republican government. While they cannot employ the filibuster to block most nominations  they still retain it for Supreme Court picks and legislation  —   at least for now. Perhaps most important  Republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment. The contemporary Republican Party has been built out of fierce opposition to Mr. Obama and deep disdain for activist government. Nearly   of current House Republicans have never served with a Republican president and their entire time in Washington has been spent fighting the executive branch. As a result  Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or because the president would veto them. Now  if they can assemble the votes  their ideas will become law  —   with all the attendant consequences. Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit  approve annual budgets  endorse spending bills and back other   measures that they formerly left to the Democrats and some of their more compromising colleagues. With Democrats unlikely to help on many of those votes after being castigated for them by Republicans  the Republicans who belonged to the “vote no  hope yes” caucus when it came to critical legislation in recent years now will have to vote yes and hope things go well. This isn’t the same style of Republican majority pushed from power after being routed in the 2006 midterm elections after the public backlash to the administration of President George W. Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq. Forged by the Tea Party revolt that restored Republicans to control of the House in the 2010 elections  and in the Senate in 2014  this party is much more conservative with a membership that tends to see government as an impediment to be leveled  not as a force to be shaped to their views to the benefit of their constituents. Eight years of railing against the Obama administration has infused them and their constituents with a hostility and disregard for the government that Republicans must now lead rather than ridicule. Tensions could arise between House and Senate Republicans as well. When the Newt   party took over the House in 1995 for the first time in four decades  newly empowered Republicans sent a raft of legislation to the Senate  only to see it stall there. With President Bill Clinton in the White House at the time  Republicans knew much of it would not be enacted. Now  with Mr. Trump soon to occupy the Oval Office  it is unlikely that House Republicans will be willing to watch Democrats bottle up legislation in the Senate. Demands that their Senate counterparts eliminate the filibuster could mount quickly. While they understand the challenges  Republicans are nonetheless jubilant at their enviable position. “A Republican in the White House and a Republican majority in Congress present tremendous opportunity to make real progress ” Senator Cory Gardner  Republican of Colorado  said in the party’s weekly radio address on Saturday. “We assume that responsibility with the promise that we’ll work hard to do everything that we can to deliver more opportunities to Americans tomorrow than they have today. ” “I am pretty giddy 2017.0 1.0 "Good morning.

Enjoy. “I Can’t Drive 55 ” the rocker Sammy Hagar once famously wailed  but 43 years ago this week  he and every other American driver were faced with obeying the first federal speed limit. Setting speed limits had been the states’ responsibility. But in 1973  OPEC cut oil shipments to the United States for supporting Israel in a war with its Arab neighbors. The embargo hit the American economy hard. In 1974  President Richard M. Nixon signed the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act  lowering the speed limit to reduce consumption. And American car buyers sought out more   vehicles  turning to a country that had not yet been celebrated for automaking: Japan. The debate over road safety and speed limits continued for decades  and in 1995  President Bill Clinton repealed the federal limit  returning the power to the states. In parts of Texas  drivers can legally go 85 m. p. h. That’s the fastest in the country  though it’s slower than a few places in the world. Stretches of Germany’s autobahn have no maximum limit. It’s a far cry from one of the earliest speed restrictions. In 1901 "The body of the Iraqi prisoner was found naked and badly bruised in 2003  outside a detention center in southern Iraq run by United States Marines. The    man had been beaten  deprived of sleep  forced to stand for long periods and interrogated by Marines about his alleged role in a fatal ambush of American forces. James N. Mattis    Donald J. Trump’s nominee for secretary of defense  was then a major general and the commander of the Marine division in Iraq responsible for the center. He quickly convened an inquiry into the death  which led to   and banned the harsh techniques used at the prison. “General Mattis was all up in arms over this ” Ralph Dengler  then a lieutenant colonel  testified at a military hearing in January 2004. He added that the commander  who arrived hours after the discovery on a planned visit with his British counterpart  had immediately described the death as “the worst thing that happened” under his watch in the Iraq war. “I was surprised that he would have felt that strongly about it  considering many of the other deaths  including American deaths ” Colonel Dengler said. Colleagues say the general’s handling of the episode reflects his firmly held views against torture and prisoner mistreatment  which are shared by many military leaders and could put them at odds with the new commander in chief. Mr. Trump  in a New York Times interview in late November  said he had been surprised to learn that the man he was considering to lead the country’s 2. 2 million service members did not believe in torture. During the presidential campaign  Mr. Trump advocated bringing back the   practice of waterboarding  adding that “only a stupid person would say it doesn’t work. ” General Mattis does not support abusive techniques  let alone waterboarding. “Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers ” he told Mr. Trump during their meeting in November  according to the   “and I do better with that than I do with torture. ” The general’s beliefs were shaped by his military training  but also by his experiences in dealing with issues related to torture or mistreatment  according to an examination of his nearly   career and interviews with former colleagues and friends. General Mattis led the United States Central Command from August 2010 to March 2013. Lt. Col. T. G. Taylor  who was General Mattis’s spokesman during much of that time  said in an interview that the commander had spoken of America as needing to hold the moral high ground. Failing to uphold important principles “makes it easier for a soldier or a Marine to ask  ‘What am I fighting for? ’” Colonel Taylor said. “That is something that General Mattis is keenly aware of ” he added. As a young officer  General Mattis would have been instructed in the laws of war  including the Geneva Conventions  which  among other protections  require humane treatment of prisoners of war. A Marine who enlisted in 1969 while attending college  —   part of an R. O. T. C. program during the height of the Vietnam War  —   he did not deploy to Vietnam. But  several friends say  he believed that American prisoners of war were more likely to be tortured by the Vietcong if the United States tortured enemy captives. In 2006  General Mattis supported Gen. David H. Petraeus of the Army and other military leaders in the development of a new counterinsurgency field manual that highlighted limits on interrogation tactics. “Torture and cruel  inhuman  and degrading treatment is never a morally permissible option  even if lives depend on gaining information ” the manual said. “Lose moral legitimacy  lose the war. ” General Mattis later agreed in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that it was inappropriate for the military to support the use of abusive techniques on detainees  —   including waterboarding  forced nudity and sensory deprivation  tactics inflicted on prisoners during interrogations in secret C. I. A. prisons in the years after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Those techniques had been modeled on a military training program operated by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency  which later fell under the general’s command. That program  Survival  Evasion  Resistance and Escape  also known as SERE  exposed United States soldiers and other service members to techniques that an enemy violating the laws of war might use so that Americans could be better prepared to resist them. The experience typically led trainees to conclude that tortured prisoners of war will say whatever they need to in order to stay alive  whether true or not. A recent investigation by The New York Times found that many terrorism suspects subjected to harsh tactics in C. I. A. jails or American military prisons had lasting mental health problems that were similar to those experienced by some American former P. O. W.s who suffered horrific abuses in Vietnam or Korea. As a commander in Afghanistan and later in Iraq  and as an overall leader of the American war effort  General Mattis often grappled with the consequences of the C. I. A. ’s treatment of prisoners and the harsh conditions at the military detention center at Guantánamo Bay  Cuba. They became a powerful recruiting tool for jihadis who threatened American forces in the field. Testifying at a Senate hearing in 2015 after his retirement  General Mattis opposed the release  before the end of hostilities  of prisoners who had fought against the United States. However  he added  they should be treated humanely  in accordance with international and domestic law. “I would go by the Geneva Conventions  and maintain them  with Red Cross oversight  until the war is over ” he told lawmakers. Torture is not effective in eliciting intelligence  the general felt. “For his whole career  he’s believed that it just doesn’t pay dividends ” said a retired senior United States military officer who is close to General Mattis but spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating Mr. Trump. The “pack of cigarettes” reference  according to people who served with the general  reflects two tenets that are drummed into future military leaders: that information gleaned from torture is unreliable  and that   can go a long way. “I’m not in his head  but what General Mattis was saying is that offering a modicum of friendship and humanity to someone in a desperate situation is more successful than physical torture ” Colonel Taylor said. Hope Hicks  a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump’s transition team  declined requests for more detail on the  ’s discussions with General Mattis or on the source of General Mattis’s beliefs and any further thoughts Mr. Trump has had about the use of torture. General Mattis declined to be interviewed. Many American military leaders maintain that the Bush administration’s departure from established practices in allowing harsh coercive techniques  —   government lawyers had said they did not meet the legal definition of torture  and had declared that detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions  —   tainted the United States’ reputation while not yielding results. “Ineffective  war crime  against our values  moral high ground  et cetera ” Donald J. Guter  a retired rear admiral and the dean of the South Texas College of Law  said in explaining objections to brutal treatment. “A very practical reason is that it opens the door for our own troops to be tortured  and we have no basis to object. If we torture  we’ve lost who we are. ” The Department of Defense has clear policies on the humane treatment of detainees. For example  the Army field manual’s section on intelligence collection states: “Use of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results. ” The manual adds  “Cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment is prohibited. ” As a commander in Iraq  General Mattis ordered several investigations into detainee abuse. One of the most significant concerned the 2003 death at a makeshift detention and interrogation center in an abandoned Iraqi Army barracks in southern Iraq  christened Camp Whitehorse. Prisoners were held by United States Marine reservists in extreme heat in a dirty  stone building that had been looted of all amenities by Iraqis during the   invasion. The prisoner who died  Nagem Sadoon Hatab  had been arrested days earlier on suspicion of involvement in a deadly ambush of a United States Army convoy that led to the capture of Jessica Lynch  a    private who was later rescued. Mr. Hatab was alleged to have killed American service members and sold an   rifle taken from one of them. Mr. Hatab failed to stand up while being subjected to     treatment  —   forced standing for 50 minutes of each hour  for up to 10 hours. The objective was to make the detainees tired  stressed and submissive for interrogators  witnesses later said in military court hearings. Like other prisoners at the center  Mr. Hatab was hooded and his hands were restrained behind his back with plastic ties. He was beaten severely by Marine guards after refusing to comply with the forced standing and  . He also underwent questioning by a special Marine interrogation squad. A Marine guard later testified that he had often heard yelling  screaming and banging from the interrogation room  a converted bathroom. After midnight on June 6  2003  Mr. Hatab was found dead in a courtyard where he had been left lying for hours  his body covered in his own feces. An armed forces medical examiner categorized the death as a homicide. Mr. Hatab had six broken ribs and had suffocated from a broken bone in his throat after being dragged outside by his neck  the examiner concluded. Eight Camp Whitehorse personnel were charged with crimes  including negligent homicide. But the investigator appointed by General Mattis  Col. William B. Gallo  later cited problems with the autopsy and could not determine which of the attacks on Mr. Hatab  if any  might have been lethal. In Colonel Gallo’s opinion  the   treatment did not amount to torture  but the command had failed to provide adequate predeployment training in handling prisoners and in the law of war. Evidence  including certain photographs of the prisoner and a summary of an interrogation he underwent  had been lost or destroyed  complicating the investigation and prosecution. Two Marines  a major and a sergeant  were eventually convicted of lesser charges. Mr. Hatab’s death clearly had an effect on General Mattis. According to reports at the time  he ordered a review of the procedures for handling prisoners  which resulted in a ban of   tactics  including the forced standing. Marine Corps personnel running detention camps were given more training  and a manual was compiled to explain each step of the process. Still  there were several other instances of prisoner abuse involving the division. Later  aiming to earn the trust of the Iraqi people after the first phase of combat had ended  General Mattis added an addendum to the motto of his Marines: “No better friend  no worse enemy. ” The addition was  “First
