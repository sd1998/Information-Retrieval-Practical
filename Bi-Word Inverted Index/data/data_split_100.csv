1.0 "WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump is expected to choose as director of national intelligence   Senator Dan Coats  a former ambassador to Germany  secret foodie and lover of all things Indiana who also served as a member of his chamber’s Intelligence Committee. Known for a   style  Mr. Coats was popular among his colleagues. “I always thought he should wear a red cardigan ” said Senator Cory Gardner  Republican of Colorado. “He was the closest thing to Mister Rogers we could come up with. ” While fiscally conservative  Mr. Coats  an Indiana Republican who completed his second Senate stint this month  often found common cause with Democrats  who described him as thoughtful on intelligence and national security issues  with a sharp intellect and disarming humor. “I have always been impressed with his demeanor ” said Senator Angus King  a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats  and who served on the Intelligence Committee with Mr. Coats and traveled with him in Eastern Europe. “He’s not a fierce partisan and knows the intelligence community. He’s very amiable and easy to work with. ” The position of America’s top intelligence official was created by Congress in 2004  as a response to criticism that the nation’s spy agencies had failed to detect and prevent the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11  2001. Since then  the director has been charged with coordinating the   and analysis of the country’s 16 civilian and military spy agencies  helping to prevent a terrorist attack and serving as a central liaison to presidents and their White House staff. But bureaucratic turf wars have dogged the office of the director of national intelligence since its creation. Officials who run the C. I. A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency  among others  have sought to maintain control over parts of the spying apparatus  and to exert influence with presidents and members of Congress. In 2009  for example  Leon E. Panetta  President Obama’s incoming C. I. A. director  clashed with Dennis C. Blair  the director of national intelligence at the time  after Mr. Blair sought to select the top American spies for overseas postings. Mr. Panetta sent a dispatch to the agency’s employees telling them to ignore Mr. Blair’s message  —   an assertion that the C. I. A. was in charge. The rivalries have weakened the national intelligence office and led some critics in the government to question its effectiveness. The year that Mr. Obama took office  an internal report criticized the office of national intelligence for adding to  —   not removing  —   bureaucratic bloat and doing little to end the tensions among the various spy agencies. In 2010  James R. Clapper Jr. the current director of national intelligence  insisted during his Senate confirmation hearings that he would not be a “hood ornament ” saying that despite the inherent limitations on his job  he would try to bring an end to turf battles among the nation’s spy agencies. Six years later  the job appears to have limited appeal to some intelligence professionals  several of whom were not eager to serve in the position for fear that they would not be empowered. Mr. Coats had been an early and strong contender for secretary of defense in the first term of President George W. Bush  until Mr. Bush’s vice president  Dick Cheney  successfully pressed for Donald H. Rumsfeld. Mr. Coats  73  graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois  and served in the Army before studying at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. He began a career in life insurance in Fort Wayne  Ind. before joining the office of   Dan Quayle as a district representative. Mr. Coats owed much of his political career to his ties to Mr. Quayle  the former vice president. Mr. Coats won Mr. Quayle’s House seat in 1980  the year the latter was elected to the Senate. After Mr. Quayle was elected vice president in 1988  Mr. Coats was appointed to fill his seat he served on the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. In 1998  Mr. Coats decided to not seek   largely because the Democratic challenger  Evan Bayh  was considered unbeatable. In 2001  Mr. Coats was named ambassador to Germany  arriving only three days before the Sept. 11 attacks. “Ambassador Coats found himself thrown into a role he couldn’t have foreseen a day earlier  a role in which he would excel but one that would forever change him ” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the Republican leader  said on the Senate floor last year in remarks praising Mr. Coats. “Those who know Dan Coats say that day in September affected him profoundly ” he said. “He may not have known it then  but he would feel the tug of that responsibility many years later  and answer the call. ” After a brief foray into lobbying  Mr. Coats returned to the Senate in January 2011  serving again on the Intelligence Committee. Mr. Coats was also one of only a few Republican senators who supported compelling Congress to officially authorize the use of military force abroad. “You’re asking our sons and daughters to take up our cause ” he said  “and every person who is here has to decide with their own conscience if that’s something we’re going to do. ” Mr. Coats enjoys visiting restaurants both in Indianapolis and in small hamlets that serve    food 4.0 "WASHINGTON  —   When Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the Democratic National Committee in September 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network  he was transferred  naturally  to the help desk. His message was brief  if alarming. At least one computer system belonging to the D. N. C. had been compromised by hackers federal investigators had named “the Dukes ” a cyberespionage team linked to the Russian government. The F. B. I. knew it well: The bureau had spent the last few years trying to kick the Dukes out of the unclassified email systems of the White House  the State Department and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff  one of the government’s   networks. Yared Tamene  the   contractor at the D. N. C. who fielded the call  was no expert in cyberattacks. His first moves were to check Google for “the Dukes” and conduct a cursory search of the D. N. C. computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion. By his own account  he did not look too hard even after Special Agent Hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks  —   in part because he wasn’t certain the caller was a real F. B. I. agent and not an impostor. “I had no way of differentiating the call I just received from a prank call ” Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo  obtained by The New York Times  that detailed his contact with the F. B. I. It was the cryptic first sign of a cyberespionage and   campaign devised to disrupt the 2016 presidential election  the first such attempt by a foreign power in American history. What started as an   operation  intelligence officials believe  ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate  Hillary Clinton  and tip the election to her opponent  Donald J. Trump. Like another famous American election scandal  it started with a   at the D. N. C. The first time  44 years ago at the committee’s old offices in the Watergate complex  the burglars planted listening devices and jimmied a filing cabinet. This time  the burglary was conducted from afar  directed by the Kremlin  with   emails and zeros and ones. An examination by The Times of the Russian operation  —   based on interviews with dozens of players targeted in the attack  intelligence officials who investigated it and Obama administration officials who deliberated over the best response  —   reveals a series of missed signals  slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of the cyberattack. The D. N. C. ’s fumbling encounter with the F. B. I. meant the best chance to halt the Russian intrusion was lost. The failure to grasp the scope of the attacks undercut efforts to minimize their impact. And the White House’s reluctance to respond forcefully meant the Russians have not paid a heavy price for their actions  a decision that could prove critical in deterring future cyberattacks. The   approach of the F. B. I. meant that Russian hackers could roam freely through the committee’s network for nearly seven months before top D. N. C. officials were alerted to the attack and hired cyberexperts to protect their systems. In the meantime  the hackers moved on to targets outside the D. N. C. including Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman  John D. Podesta  whose private email account was hacked months later. Even Mr. Podesta  a savvy Washington insider who had written a 2014 report on cyberprivacy for President Obama  did not truly understand the gravity of the hacking. By last summer  Democrats watched in helpless fury as their private emails and confidential documents appeared online day after day  —   procured by Russian intelligence agents  posted on WikiLeaks and other websites  then eagerly reported on by the American media  including The Times. Mr. Trump gleefully cited many of the purloined emails on the campaign trail. The fallout included the resignations of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida  the chairwoman of the D. N. C. and most of her top party aides. Leading Democrats were sidelined at the height of the campaign  silenced by revelations of embarrassing emails or consumed by the scramble to deal with the hacking. Though   by the public  confidential documents taken by the Russian hackers from the D. N. C. ’s sister organization  the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  turned up in congressional races in a dozen states  tainting some of them with accusations of scandal. In recent days  a skeptical   the nation’s intelligence agencies and the two major parties have become embroiled in an extraordinary public dispute over what evidence exists that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia moved beyond mere espionage to deliberately try to subvert American democracy and pick the winner of the presidential election. Many of Mrs. Clinton’s closest aides believe that the Russian assault had a profound impact on the election  while conceding that other factors  —   Mrs. Clinton’s weaknesses as a candidate her private email server the public statements of the F. B. I. director  James B. Comey  about her handling of classified information  —   were also important. While there’s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack  this much is clear: A     weapon that Russia had   in elections from Ukraine to Europe was trained on the United States  with devastating effectiveness. For Russia  with an enfeebled economy and a nuclear arsenal it cannot use short of   war  cyberpower proved the perfect weapon: cheap  hard to see coming  hard to trace. “There shouldn’t be any doubt in anybody’s mind ” Adm. Michael S. Rogers  the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command  said at a postelection conference. “This was not something that was done casually  this was not something that was done by chance  this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily ” he said. “This was a conscious effort by a   to attempt to achieve a specific effect. ” For the people whose emails were stolen  this new form of political sabotage has left a trail of shock and professional damage. Neera Tanden  president of the Center for American Progress and a key Clinton supporter  recalls walking into the busy Clinton transition offices  humiliated to see her face on television screens as pundits discussed a leaked email in which she had called Mrs. Clinton’s instincts “suboptimal. ” “It was just a sucker punch to the gut every day ” Ms. Tanden said. “It was the worst professional experience of my life. ” The United States  too  has carried out cyberattacks  and in decades past the C. I. A. tried to subvert foreign elections. But the Russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark  —   with one notable exception: Mr. Trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as “ridiculous ” insisting that the hacker may be American  or Chinese  but that “they have no idea. ” Mr. Trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether Mr. Putin intended to help elect him. On Tuesday  a Russian government spokesman echoed Mr. Trump’s scorn. “This tale of ‘hacks’ resembles a banal brawl between American security officials over spheres of influence ” Maria Zakharova  the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry  wrote on Facebook. Over the weekend  four prominent senators  —   two Republicans and two Democrats  —   joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring Mr. Trump’s skeptical claims. “Democrats and Republicans must work together  and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress  to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks ” said Senators John McCain  Lindsey Graham  Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed. “This cannot become a partisan issue ” they said. “The stakes are too high for our country. ” Sitting in the basement of the Democratic National Committee headquarters  below a   2012 portrait of a smiling Barack Obama  is a   filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer. Only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture. “GOP Security Aide Among 5 Arrested in Bugging Affair ” reads the headline from the front page of The Washington Post on June 19  1972  with the bylines of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Andrew Brown  37  the technology director at the D. N. C. was born after that famous  . But as he began to plan for this year’s election cycle  he was well aware that the D. N. C. could become a   target again. There were aspirations to ensure that the D. N. C. was well protected against cyberintruders  —   and then there was the reality  Mr. Brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged: The D. N. C. was a nonprofit group  dependent on donations  with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have. “There was never enough money to do everything we needed to do ” Mr. Brown said. The D. N. C. had a standard email   service  intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email. But when Russian hackers started in on the D. N. C. the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic  internal D. N. C. memos show. Mr. Tamene  who reports to Mr. Brown and fielded the call from the F. B. I. agent  was not a   D. N. C. employee he works for a   contracting firm called The MIS Department. He was left to figure out  largely on his own  how to respond  —   and even whether the man who had called in to the D. N. C. switchboard was really an F. B. I. agent. “The F. B. I. thinks the D. N. C. has at least one compromised computer on its network and the F. B. I. wanted to know if the D. N. C. is aware  and if so  what the D. N. C. is doing about it ” Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the F. B. I. He added that “the Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed ‘Dukes’ by the U. S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles. ” Part of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D. N. C. Nor could he email anyone there  as that risked alerting the hackers that the F. B. I. knew they were in the system. Mr. Tamene’s initial scan of the D. N. C. system  —   using his    tools and incomplete targeting information from the F. B. I.  —   found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October  leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene  urging him to call back  “I did not return his calls  as I had nothing to report ” Mr. Tamene explained in his memo. In November  Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D. N. C. computer was “calling home  where home meant Russia ” Mr. Tamene’s memo says  referring to software sending information to Moscow. “SA Hawkins added that the F. B. I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a   attack. ” Mr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene  who declined to comment  was fielding calls from the F. B. I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  Mrs. Clinton’s main Democratic opponent  had improperly gained access to her campaign data. Ms. Wasserman Schultz  then the D. N. C. ’s chairwoman  and Amy Dacey  then its chief executive  said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee’s system had likely been compromised. Shawn Henry  who once led the F. B. I. ’s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services  the cybersecurity firm retained by the D. N. C. in April  said he was baffled that the F. B. I. did not call a more senior official at the D. N. C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response. “We are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of Montana ” Mr. Henry said. “We are talking about an office that is half a mile from the F. B. I. office that is getting the notification. ” “This is not a    delicatessen or a local library. This is a critical piece of the U. S. infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process  our elected officials  our legislative process  our executive process ” he added. “To me it is a   serious issue  and if after a couple of months you don’t see any results  somebody ought to raise that to a higher level. ” The F. B. I. declined to comment on the agency’s handling of the hack. “The F. B. I. takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems ” it said in a statement  adding that agents “will continue to share information” to help targets “safeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals. ” By March  Mr. Tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the F. B. I. and concluded that Agent Hawkins was really a federal employee. But then the situation took a dire turn. A second team of   hackers began to target the D. N. C. and other players in the political world  particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart  a former D. N. C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign  got an odd email warning from Google. “Someone just used your password to try to sign into your Google account ” the March 22 email said  adding that the   attempt had occurred in Ukraine. “Google stopped this   attempt. You should change your password immediately. ” Mr. Rinehart was in Hawaii at the time. He remembers checking his email at 4 a. m. for messages from East Coast associates. Without thinking much about the notification  he clicked on the “change password” button and half asleep  as best he can remember  he typed in a new password. What he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account. Hundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to American political targets  including an identical email sent on March 19 to Mr. Podesta  chairman of the Clinton campaign. Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account  several aides also had access to it  and one of them noticed the warning email  sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the “change password” button. “This is a legitimate email ” Charles Delavan  a Clinton campaign aide  replied to another of Mr. Podesta’s aides  who had noticed the alert. “John needs to change his password immediately. ” With another click  a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account  —   a total of about 60  000  —   were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan  in an interview  said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack  as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an “illegitimate” email  an error that he said has plagued him ever since. During this second wave  the hackers also gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  and then  through a virtual private network connection  to the main computer network of the D. N. C. The F. B. I. observed this surge of activity as well  again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him. Yet Mr. Tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed: He found copies of the phishing emails in the D. N. C. ’s spam filter. But he had no reason  he said  to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated. One bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of April: The D. N. C. seven months after it had first been warned  finally installed a “robust set of monitoring tools ” Mr. Tamene’s internal memo says. The United States had two decades of warning that Russia’s intelligence agencies were trying to break into America’s most sensitive computer networks. But the Russians have always managed to stay a step ahead. Their first major attack was detected on Oct. 7  1996  when a computer operator at the Colorado School of Mines discovered some nighttime computer activity he could not explain. The school had a major contract with the Navy  and the operator warned his contacts there. But as happened two decades later at the D. N. C. at first “everyone was unable to connect the dots ” said Thomas Rid  a scholar at King’s College in London who has studied the attack. Investigators gave it a name  —   Moonlight Maze  —   and spent two years  often working day and night  tracing how it hopped from the Navy to the Department of Energy to the Air Force and NASA. In the end  they concluded that the total number of files stolen  if printed and stacked  would be taller than the Washington Monument. Whole weapons designs were flowing out the door  and it was a first taste of what was to come: an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world. But for years  the Russians stayed largely out of the headlines  thanks to the Chinese  —   who took bigger risks  and often got caught. They stole the designs for the   fighter jet  corporate secrets for rolling steel  even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle  Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain  making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn’t publish any of it. The Russians had not gone away  of course. “They were just a lot more stealthy ” said Kevin Mandia  a former Air Force intelligence officer who spent most of his days fighting off Russian cyberattacks before founding Mandiant  a cybersecurity firm that is now a division of FireEye  —   and the company the Clinton campaign brought in to secure its own systems. The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia  a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO  sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia’s war with Georgia. But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching “cyber Pearl Harbor”  —   a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks. But in 2014 and 2015  a Russian hacking group began systematically targeting the State Department  the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Each time  they eventually met with some form of success ” Michael Sulmeyer  a former cyberexpert for the secretary of defense  and Ben Buchanan  now both of the Harvard Cyber Security Project  wrote recently in a    published paper for the Carnegie Endowment. The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier  tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic “command and control” messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point  officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them. Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this  but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly  or issue sanctions. There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar  and concern that the United States needed Russia’s cooperation in negotiations over Syria. “We’d have all these circular meetings ” one senior State Department official said  “in which everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard. But it didn’t happen. ” So the Russians escalated again  —   breaking into systems not just for espionage  but to publish or broadcast what they found  known as “doxing” in the cyberworld. It was a brazen change in tactics  moving the Russians from espionage to influence operations. In February 2014  they broadcast an intercepted phone call between Victoria Nuland  the assistant secretary of state who handles Russian affairs and has a contentious relationship with Mr. Putin  and Geoffrey Pyatt  the United States ambassador to Ukraine. Ms. Nuland was heard describing a   American effort to broker a deal in Ukraine  then in political turmoil. They were not the only ones on whom the Russians used the    strategy. The Open Society Foundation  run by George Soros  was a major target  and when its documents were released  some turned out to have been altered to make it appear as if the foundation was financing Russian opposition members. Last year  the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station  frying critical hardware. Around Christmas  it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine  dropping a portion of the country into darkness  killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect  it was a warning shot. The attacks “were not fully integrated military operations ” Mr. Sulmeyer said. But they showed an increasing boldness. The day before the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner in April  Ms. Dacey  the D. N. C. ’s chief executive  was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call. With the new monitoring system in place  Mr. Tamene had examined administrative logs of the D. N. C. ’s computer system and found something very suspicious: An unauthorized person  with   security status  had gained access to the D. N. C. ’s computers. “Not sure it is related to what the F. B. I. has been noticing ” said one internal D. N. C. email sent on April 29. “The D. N. C. may have been hacked in a serious way this week  with password theft  etc. ” No one knew just how bad the breach was  —   but it was clear that a lot more than a single filing cabinet worth of materials might have been taken. A secret committee was immediately created  including Ms. Dacey  Ms. Wasserman Schultz  Mr. Brown and Michael Sussmann  a former cybercrimes prosecutor at the Department of Justice who now works at Perkins Coie  the Washington law firm that handles D. N. C. political matters. “Three most important questions ” Mr. Sussmann wrote to his clients the night the   was confirmed. “1) What data was accessed? 2) How was it done? 3) How do we stop it?” Mr. Sussmann instructed his clients not to use D. N. C. email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out  —   an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the D. N. C. was on to them. “You only get one chance to raise the drawbridge ” Mr. Sussmann said. “If the adversaries know you are aware of their presence  they will take steps to burrow in  or erase the logs that show they were present. ” The D. N. C. immediately hired CrowdStrike  a cybersecurity firm  to scan its computers  identify the intruders and build a new computer and telephone system from scratch. Within a day  CrowdStrike confirmed that the intrusion had originated in Russia  Mr. Sussmann said. The work that such companies do is a computer version of   crime scene investigation  with fingerprints  bullet casings and DNA swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating. And just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar  so CrowdStrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. Those are CrowdStrike’s nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D. N. C. network. Cozy Bear  —   the group also known as the Dukes or A. P. T. 29  for “advanced persistent threat”  —   may or may not be associated with the F. S. B. the main successor to the   K. G. B. but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014  said Dmitri Alperovitch  CrowdStrike’s   and chief technology officer. It was Cozy Bear  CrowdStrike concluded  that first penetrated the D. N. C. in the summer of 2015  by sending   emails to a long list of American government agencies  Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message  the Russians would enter the network  “exfiltrate” documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes. “Once they got into the D. N. C. they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation ” said Mr. Alperovitch  who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager. Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up  —   first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  and then jumping to the D. N. C. investigators believe. Fancy Bear  sometimes called A. P. T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G. R. U. Russia’s military intelligence agency  is an older outfit  tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta’s email. Attribution  as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known  is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time  by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets  it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear  for instance  has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia  and at NATO installations. That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries  Mr. Alperovitch said. “There’s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia ” he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone. To their astonishment  Mr. Alperovitch said  CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear  apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D. N. C. files for months  took many of the same documents. In the six weeks after CrowdStrike’s arrival  in total secrecy  the computer system at the D. N. C. was replaced. For a weekend  email and phones were shut off employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean  with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives. Though D. N. C. officials had learned that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been infected  too  they did not notify their sister organization  which was in the same building  because they were afraid that it would leak. All of this work took place as the bitter contest for the Democratic nomination continued to play out between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders  and it was already causing a major distraction for Ms. Wasserman Schultz and the D. N. C. ’s chief executive. “This was not a bump in the road  —   bumps in the road happen all the time ” she said in an interview. “Two different Russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property. And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling. ” The D. N. C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F. B. I. officials in   nine months after the bureau’s first call to the   contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting  according to participants: that the federal government make a quick “attribution” formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage. “You have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D. N. C.  ” Mr. Sussmann said  recalling the message to the F. B. I. “We need to tell the American public that. And soon. ” In   on Mr. Sussmann’s advice  D. N. C. leaders decided to take a bold step. Concerned that word of the hacking might leak  they decided to go public in The Washington Post with the news that the committee had been attacked. That way  they figured  they could get ahead of the story  win a little sympathy from voters for being victimized by Russian hackers and refocus on the campaign. But the very next day  a new  deeply unsettling shock awaited them. Someone calling himself Guccifer 2. 0 appeared on the web  claiming to be the D. N. C. hacker  —   and he posted a confidential committee document detailing Mr. Trump’s record and half a dozen other documents to prove his bona fides. “And it’s just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks ” he wrote. Then something more ominous: “The main part of the papers  thousands of files and mails  I gave to WikiLeaks. They will publish them soon. ” It was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee’s network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage  an unpredictable  uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns. Guccifer 2. 0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker  a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush  former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D. N. C. ’s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2. 0 called himself a “lone hacker” and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers “sophisticated. ” But online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim  Lorenzo   a writer for Motherboard  the tech and culture site of Vice  tried to contact Guccifer 2. 0 by direct message on Twitter. “Surprisingly  he answered right away ” Mr.   said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. “I asked him why he did it  and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian. ” That gave Mr.   an idea. Using Google Translate  he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline  Mr.   checked with a couple of native speakers  who told him Guccifer 2. 0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well  —   and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be. Cyberresearchers found other clues pointing to Russia. Microsoft Word documents posted by Guccifer 2. 0 had been edited by someone calling himself  in Russian  Felix Edmundovich  —   an obvious nom de guerre honoring the founder of the Soviet secret police  Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky. Bad links in the texts were marked by warnings in Russian  generated by what was clearly a   version of Word. When Mr.   managed to engage Guccifer 2. 0 over a period of weeks  he found that his interlocutor’s tone and manner changed. “At first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later  he was curt and more calculating ” he said. “It seemed like a group of people  and a very sloppy attempt to cover up. ” Computer experts drew the same conclusion about DCLeaks. com  a site that sprang up in June  claiming to be the work of “hacktivists” but posting more stolen documents. It  too  seemed to be a clumsy front for the same Russians who had stolen the documents. Notably  the website was registered in April  suggesting that the Russian hacking team planned well in advance to make public what it stole. In addition to what Guccifer 2. 0 published on his site  he provided material directly on request to some bloggers and publications. The steady flow of Guccifer 2. 0 documents constantly undercut Democratic messaging efforts. On July 6  12 days before the Republican National Convention began in Cleveland  Guccifer released the D. N. C. ’s battle plan and budget for countering it. For Republican operatives  it was insider gold. Then WikiLeaks  a far more established outlet  began to publish the hacked material  —   just as Guccifer 2. 0 had promised. On July 22  three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia  WikiLeaks dumped out 44  053 D. N. C. emails with 17  761 attachments. Some of the messages made clear that some D. N. C. officials favored Mrs. Clinton over her progressive challenger  Mr. Sanders. That was no shock Mr. Sanders  after all  had been an independent socialist  not a Democrat  during his long career in Congress  while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party’s stars for decades. But the emails  some of them crude or insulting  infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside. Mr. Trump  by now the Republican nominee  expressed delight at the continuing jolts to his opponent  and he began to use Twitter and his stump speeches to highlight the WikiLeaks releases. On July 25  he sent out a lighthearted tweet: “The new joke in town ” he wrote  “is that Russia leaked the disastrous D. N. C.   which should never have been written (stupid) because Putin likes me. ” But WikiLeaks was far from finished. On Oct. 7  a month before the election  the site began the serial publication of thousands of private emails to and from Mr. Podesta  Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager. The same day  the United States formally accused the Russian government of being behind the hackings  in a joint statement by the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security  and Mr. Trump suffered his worst blow to date  with the release of a recording in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. The Podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the Trump video. But  released by WikiLeaks day after day over the last month of the campaign  they provided material for countless news reports. They disclosed the contents of Mrs. Clinton’s speeches to large banks  which she had refused to release. They exposed tensions inside the campaign  including disagreements over donations to the Clinton Foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and Ms. Tanden’s complaint that Mrs. Clinton’s instincts were “suboptimal. ” “I was just mortified ” Ms. Tanden said in an interview. Her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates  she recalled. “I put my hands over my head and said  ‘I can’t believe this is happening to me. ’” Though she had regularly appeared on television to support Mrs. Clinton  she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails. Ms. Tanden  like other Democrats whose messages became public  said it was obvious to her that WikiLeaks was trying its best to damage the Clinton campaign. “If you care about transparency  you put all the emails out at once ” she said. “But they wanted to hurt her. So they put them out 1  800 to 3  000 a day. ” The Trump campaign knew in advance about WikiLeaks’ plans. Days before the Podesta email release began  Roger Stone  a Republican operative working with the Trump campaign  sent out an excited tweet about what was coming. But in an interview  Mr. Stone said he had no role in the leaks he had just heard from an American with ties to WikiLeaks that damning emails were coming. Julian Assange  the WikiLeaks founder and editor  has resisted the conclusion that his site became a   for Russian hackers working for Mr. Putin’s government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy. But the evidence on both counts appears compelling. In a series of email exchanges  Mr. Assange refused to say anything about WikiLeaks’ source for the hacked material. He denied that he had made his animus toward Mrs. Clinton clear in public statements (“False. But what is this? Junior high? ”) or that the site had timed the releases for maximum negative effect on her campaign. “WikiLeaks makes its decisions based on newsworthiness  including for its recent epic scoops ” he wrote. Mr. Assange disputed the conclusion of the Oct. 7 statement from the intelligence agencies that the leaks were “intended to interfere with the U. S. election process. ” “This is false ” he wrote. “As the disclosing party we know that this was not the intent. Publishers publishing newsworthy information during an election is part of a free election. ” But asked whether he believed the leaks were one reason for Mr. Trump’s election  Mr. Assange seemed happy to take credit. “Americans extensively engaged with our publications ” he wrote. “According to Facebook statistics WikiLeaks was the most referenced political topic during October. ” Though Mr. Assange did not say so  WikiLeaks’ best defense may be the conduct of the mainstream American media. Every major publication  including The Times  published multiple stories citing the D. N. C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks  becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence. Mr. Putin  a student of martial arts  had turned two institutions at the core of American democracy  —   political campaigns and independent media  —   to his own ends. The media’s appetite for the hacked material  and its focus on the gossipy content instead of the Russian source  disturbed some of those whose personal emails were being reposted across the web. “What was really surprising to me?” Ms. Tanden said. “I could not believe that reporters were covering it. ” Inside the White House  as Mr. Obama’s advisers debated their response  their conversation turned to North Korea. In late 2014  hackers working for Kim   the North’s young and unpredictable leader  had carried out a   attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment intended to stop the Christmastime release of a comedy about a C. I. A. plot to kill Mr. Kim. In that case  embarrassing emails had also been released. But the real damage was done to Sony’s own systems: More than 70 percent of its computers melted down when a particularly virulent form of malware was released. Within weeks  intelligence agencies traced the attack back to the North and its leadership. Mr. Obama called North Korea out in public  and issued some    sanctions. The Chinese even cooperated  briefly cutting off the North’s internet connections. As the first Situation Room meetings on the Russian hacking began in July  “it was clear that Russia was going to be a much more complicated case ” said one participant. The Russians clearly had a more sophisticated understanding of American politics  and they were masters of “kompromat ” their term for compromising information. But a formal “attribution report” still had not been forwarded to the president. “It took forever ” one senior administration official said  complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system. In August a group that called itself the “Shadow Brokers” published a set of software tools that looked like what the N. S. A. uses to break into foreign computer networks and install “implants ” malware that can be used for surveillance or attack. The code came from the Tailored Access Operations unit of the N. S. A. a secretive group that mastered the arts of surveillance and cyberwar. The assumption  —   still unproved  —   was that the code was put out in the open by the Russians as a warning: Retaliate for the D. N. C. and there are a lot more secrets  from the hackings of the State Department  the White House and the Pentagon  that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in “The Godfather” where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed  as a warning. The N. S. A. said nothing. But by late August  Admiral Rogers  its director  was pressing for a more muscular response to the Russians. In his role as director of the Pentagon’s Cyber Command  he proposed a series of potential  . While officials will not discuss them in detail  the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on Mr. Putin  exposing his financial links to Russia’s oligarchs  and punching holes in the Russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out. Pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options. But in the end  none of those were formally presented to the president. In a series of “deputies meetings” run by Avril Haines  the deputy national security adviser and a former deputy director of the C. I. A. several officials warned that an overreaction by the administration would play into Mr. Putin’s hands. “If we went to Defcon 4 ” one frequent participant in Ms. Haines’s meetings said  using a phrase from the Cold War days of warnings of war  “we would be saying to the public that we didn’t have confidence in the integrity of our voting system. ” Even something seemingly straightforward  —   using the president’s executive powers  bolstered after the Sony incident  to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers  —   seemed too risky. “No one was all that eager to impose costs before Election Day ” said another participant in the classified meeting. “Any retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on Election Day. ” Instead  when Mr. Obama’s national security team reconvened after summer vacation  the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation’s voting machines and   rolls from hacking. The scenario they discussed most frequently  —   one that turned out not to be an issue  —   was a narrow vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton  followed by a declaration by Mr. Trump that the vote was “rigged” and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy. Donna Brazile  the interim chairwoman of the D. N. C. became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election  —   and still there was no broad public condemnation by the White House  or Republican Party leaders  of the attack as an act of foreign espionage. Ms. Brazile even reached out to Reince Priebus  the chairman of the Republican National Committee  urging him twice in private conversations and in a letter to join her in condemning the attacks  —   an offer he declined to take up. “We just kept hearing the government would respond  the government would respond ” she said. “Once upon a time  if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation  not as a political party. ” But Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou  China  the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense   Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote  according to White House officials who were not present for the    meeting. Later that day  Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America’s own offensive cybercapacity  which he has almost never talked about. “Frankly  both offensively and defensively  we have more capacity ” he told reporters. But when it came time to make a public assertion of Russia’s role in early October  it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security. It was far less dramatic than the president’s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony. The reference in the statement to hackings on “political organizations ” officials now say  encompassed a hacking on data stored by the Republicans as well. Two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by “human and technical” sources in Russia  which appears to mean that the United States’ implants or taps in Russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country’s role. But that may not be known for decades  until the secrets are declassified. A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate “at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact. ” Later  after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could “fundamentally alter the election ” he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent. “Hope not ” Mr. Biden responded. Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike  said Michael Morell  the former deputy director of the C. I. A. under Mr. Obama  has “got to be overt. It needs to be seen. ” A covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect  he added. “If you can’t see it  it’s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others. ” The Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that. As the year draws to a close  it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the Russian hacking  —   the intelligence review Mr. Obama has ordered completed by Jan. 20  the day he leaves office  and one or more congressional inquiries. They will wrestle with  among other things  Mr. Putin’s motive. Did he seek to mar the brand of American democracy  to forestall   activism for both Russians and their neighbors? Or to weaken the next American president  since presumably Mr. Putin had no reason to doubt American forecasts that Mrs. Clinton would win easily? Or was it  as the C. I. A. concluded last month  a deliberate attempt to elect Mr. Trump? In fact  the Russian    scheme accomplished all three goals. What seems clear is that Russian hacking  given its success  is not going to stop. Two weeks ago  the German intelligence chief  Bruno Kahl  warned that Russia might target elections in Germany next year. “The perpetrators have an interest to delegitimize the democratic process as such ” Mr. Kahl said. Now  he added  “Europe is in the focus of these attempts of disturbance  and Germany to a particularly great extent. ” But Russia has by no means forgotten its American target. On the day after the presidential election  the cybersecurity company Volexity reported five new waves of phishing emails  evidently from Cozy Bear  aimed at think tanks and nonprofits in the United States. One of them purported to be from Harvard University "When the United Nations’ top   official tried to inspect an infamous prison in Gambia two years ago  officials there denied him access. So he protested all the way up the country’s chain of command. In a tense meeting with members of the cabinet of the country’s autocratic ruler  the United Nations official  Juan E. Méndez  was again denied  this time with a jeering dismissal. “They said  ‘Why don’t you go to Guantánamo instead ’” recalled Mr. Mendez  a former United Nations special rapporteur on torture. In Bahrain  officials were a little more subtle  but the message was the same  as they twice canceled prison inspection visits. “They said we face the same threats to national security as other countries face ” Mr. Mendez said. “It was clear they were referring to the United States  and they didn’t feel that they needed to give me access. ” Now  after   Donald J. Trump’s campaign vows to reinstate the sort of torture used in the   war on terrorism  —   and to fill the Guantánamo Bay prison with “some bad dudes”  —   human rights experts fear that authoritarian regimes around the world will see it as another green light to carry out their own abuses. A return to such “enhanced interrogation”  —   and even to techniques that Mr. Trump has pledged will be “much worse”  —   would also send a powerful message just as nations around the world have begun to examine their own past abuses to ensure that they will not be repeated. “Sometimes we see progress  and then we see ” said Victor   the   of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims  a   umbrella organization for   groups. “When the U. S. was engaging in torture  that created an enormous   of the pendulum ” he added. “There were a lot of officials in other countries during the Bush administration who were saying  ‘The Americans are doing it  so why can’t we?’ Now  with Trump saying  ‘I will bring a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding ’ you can imagine how far we could go backwards. ” Nils Melzer  who succeeded Mr. Mendez as the United Nations’ special rapporteur on torture in November  warned that if the Trump administration revived the use of torture  the consequences around the world “would be catastrophic. ” A fragile consensus against torture  said José Miguel Vivanco  the regional director for the Americas for Human Rights Watch  could be shattered “when you have the White House openly advocating for torture. ” During the campaign  Mr. Trump declared that “torture works ” and he vowed to “immediately” reinstate techniques like waterboarding because “we have to beat the savages” of the Islamic State  who “deserve” such treatment even if it is fruitless. Since the election  Mr. Trump has indicated that he might be reconsidering his position  citing the firm stance against torture by James N. Mattis  his Pentagon nominee. In an interview with The New York Times in November  Mr. Trump said that he was “surprised” when Mr. Mattis told him that he opposed torture and instead favored more humane interrogations of prisoners based on rapport building. But Mr. Trump did not close the door entirely. If Americans feel strongly about bringing back waterboarding and other tactics  he said  “I would be guided by that. ” Nora Sveaass  a psychologist at the University of Oslo and a former member of the United Nations Committee Against Torture  warned that if Mr. Trump revived the use of torture by the United States  it would have a ripple effect around the globe. “The U. S. is a very strong voice ” Ms. Sveaass said. “It’s just like putting a bomb into all of those major principles  —   the absolute prohibition on torture the absolute obligation to provide redress and justice to victims of torture  including rehabilitation the obligation to investigate and hold people to account ” she added. “If one country such as the U. S. openly torpedoes those principles  you can just forget about asking for compliance from states already challenging the absolute prohibition. ” The signal from Mr. Trump that torture is acceptable again comes just as countries from Argentina to Tunisia  either through courts or special truth commissions  are engaged in tentative efforts to hold themselves accountable for past conduct. In Argentina  Omar Graffigna  the    former chief of the country’s air force  was sentenced to prison in September for the 1978 kidnapping and torture of two   activists  Patricia Roisinblit and José Manuel Pérez Rojo. The prosecution of Mr. Graffigna was just one in a series of old cases that have been brought into the courts this year in Argentina  as the nation comes to grips with the legacy of its “dirty war” of the 1970s and early 1980s. In Tunisia  a new Truth and Dignity Commission held its first hearings in November  allowing torture victims to tell their harrowing stories before a national television audience. The commission was created to investigate torture and other human rights violations dating to 1955  primarily by the regime of President Zine   Ben Ali  who was deposed during the Arab Spring in 2011. And in December  Bolivia’s legislature voted to create a truth commission to investigate torture  murders and other crimes committed by a series of authoritarian regimes from 1964 to 1982. Even in countries that have not conducted such   investigations  new     organizations have begun to take root  and those groups are trying to make it more difficult for their governments to continue to engage in torture with secrecy and impunity. Samuel Herbert Nsubuga  the chief executive of the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims  based in Uganda  said   legislation that the country passed in 2012 had still not been put into effect. When the law finally takes effect  “our challenge will be to bring some people to trial in Uganda for torture ” he said. In the meantime  his group has enlisted doctors and psychologists to provide medical help and therapy to torture victims  as well as lawyers to provide legal advice. But the moves toward examining past abuses are so far limited to relatively small nations or countries where the focus is on historical events rather than the current use of torture. The inquiries are also often being conducted in the face of strong resistance from top government officials  who oppose aggressive investigations even of past crimes. Those modest efforts could face sharp setbacks if Mr. Trump brings back banned practices. “I am afraid that Trump’s government will question the basic values of the international order  and torturing people will be justified ” said Carlos Jibaja  a psychologist with CAPS  a group in Lima  Peru  that helps victims of torture. At the same time  Mr. Trump’s advocacy of torture may encourage some major countries  like Russia and the Philippines  to be even more open and aggressive in their use of torture. Olga Sadovskaya  the vice chairwoman of the Committee Against Torture  a human rights group in Russia  said that torture was already common in the country. She noted that Russian prison and police officials routinely used torture tactics with cruel nicknames  such as the “President Putin ” which involves attaching wires from an office telephone to a victim’s body and then running electric current through it. The police like that tactic  she said  because it does not leave marks. Edeliza Hernandez  the executive director of the Medical Action Group in the Philippines  an organization that documents cases of torture and provides treatment and rehabilitation  estimated that there were 200 political prisoners in detention centers in the country  and said that most of them had been tortured. “The government has soldiers watch us while we inspect prisoners ” she said. Mr. Melzer  the United Nations official  warned that if Mr. Trump followed through on his pledges  more countries would follow his lead and get back into the torture business. “What kind of message would that be to the world?” Mr. Melzer asked. “It couldn’t be worse. What happens to the role of the United States as an example in the world  and what would that mean for the policies of other states? If the United States does it "WASHINGTON  —   Vice   Mike Pence and the top Republicans in Congress made clear on Wednesday  more powerfully and explicitly than ever  that they are dead serious about repealing the Affordable Care Act. How they can uproot a law deeply embedded in the nation’s health care system without hurting some of the 20 million people who have gained coverage through it is not clear. Nor is it yet evident that millions of Americans with   medical conditions will be fully protected against disruptions in their health coverage. But a determined Republican president and Congress can gut the Affordable Care Act  and do it quickly: a    health care revolution in reverse that would undo many of the changes made since the law was signed by President Obama in March 2010. The Senate intends to pass a budget resolution next week that would shield repeal legislation from a Democratic filibuster. If the Senate completes its action  House Republican leaders hope that they  too  can approve a version of the budget resolution next week. Whether they can meet that goal is unclear. The resolution contains seemingly innocuous language  instructing four committees that control health care policy  —   two in the Senate  two in the House  —   to draft legislation within their jurisdiction that would cut at least $1 billion from the deficit over 10 years. But that language has real teeth. The legislation produced to meet those instructions can pass the Senate with a simple majority  —   51 votes if all senators are present  —   obliterating the power of the Democratic minority to block it. Those four committees would have just a few weeks  until Jan. 27  to produce legislation repealing major provisions of the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans have some practice at this  because they have voted more than 60 times since 2011 to repeal some or all of the law. The budget blueprint will guide Congress but will not be presented to the president for a signature or veto. The committees  —   House Energy and Commerce  House Ways and Means  Senate Finance  and Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  —   will quickly assemble legislation intended to eviscerate the health care law. The repeal legislation will be in the form of a reconciliation bill  authorized by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Such bills can be adopted under special   procedures. But Senate rules generally bar the use of those procedures for measures that have no effect on spending or revenue. So the legislation  as now conceived  would probably leave the most popular provisions of the health law intact  such as the prohibition on insurers’ denying coverage to people with   conditions. Instead  the legislation would: ■ Eliminate the tax penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees. ■ Eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid. ■ Repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges. It could also repeal some of the taxes and fees that help pay for the expansion of coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But some Republicans have indicated that they may want to use some of that revenue for their    plan to replace the health care law. The 2010 law imposed taxes and fees on certain   people and on health insurers and manufacturers of   prescription drugs and medical devices  among others. Republicans have not said for sure which taxes they will scrap and which they may keep. Republicans say they will delay the effective date of their repeal bill to avoid disrupting coverage and to provide time for them to develop alternatives to Mr. Obama’s law. They disagree over how long the delay should last  with two to four years being mentioned as possibilities. Within days of taking office    Donald J. Trump plans to announce executive actions on health care. Some may undo Obama administration policies. Others will be meant to stabilize health insurance markets and prevent them from collapsing in a vast sea of uncertainty. “We are working on a series of executive orders that the   will put into effect to ensure that there is an orderly transition  during the period after we repeal Obamacare  to a   health care economy ” Mr. Pence said at the Capitol on Wednesday. He did not provide details  and Trump transition aides said they had no information about the executive orders. But some options are apparent. The federal government could continue providing financial assistance to insurance companies to protect them against financial losses and to prevent consumers’ premiums from soaring more than they have in the last few years. Even as they move full speed toward gutting the existing health law  Republicans are scrambling to find a replacement. At the moment  they have no consensus. Mr. Pence said on Wednesday that the replacement would probably encourage greater use of personal health savings accounts and make it easier for carriers to sell insurance across state lines. Also  he said  it would encourage small businesses to band together and buy insurance through “association health plans” sponsored by business and professional organizations. Some type of subsidy or tax credit for consumers  to help defray the cost of premiums  is also likely. States would have more authority to set insurance standards  and the federal government would have less. Mr. Trump has also endorsed the idea of   “  pools” for people with   conditions who would otherwise have difficulty finding affordable coverage. Many experts have said that repealing the health law without a clear plan to replace it could create havoc in insurance markets. Doctors  hospitals and insurance companies do not know what to expect. Without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance  and without subsidies to buy it  supporters of the law say many healthy people would go without coverage  knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it. Democrats in Congress say they will do everything they can to thwart Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. They plan to dramatize their case by publicizing the experiences of people whose lives have been saved or improved by the law. In the Senate next week  Democrats will demand votes intended to put Republicans on record against proposals that could protect consumers. Defenders of the law also hope to mobilize groups like the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association to speak up for patients. The Senate Democratic leader  Chuck Schumer of New York  and the House Democratic leader  Nancy Pelosi of California  are encouraging their colleagues to organize rallies around the country on Jan. 15 to oppose the Republicans’ health care agenda. And to buttress their case  Democrats are compiling statistics from the White House and from researchers at   groups like the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  the Commonwealth Fund and the Urban Institute 1.0 "WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump’s transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day  according to several American diplomats familiar with the plan  breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods. The mandate  —   issued “without exceptions ” according to a terse State Department cable sent on Dec. 23  diplomats who saw it said  —   threatens to leave the United States without   envoys for months in critical nations like Germany  Canada and Britain. In the past  administrations of both parties have often granted extensions on a    basis to allow a handful of ambassadors  particularly those with   children  to remain in place for weeks or months. Mr. Trump  by contrast  has taken a hard line against leaving any of President Obama’s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20 with a mission of dismantling many of his predecessor’s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements. “Political” ambassadors  many of them major donors who are nominated by virtue of close ties with the president  almost always leave at the end of his term ambassadors who are career diplomats often remain in their posts. A senior Trump transition official said there was no ill will in the move  describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that Mr. Obama’s overseas appointees leave the government on schedule  just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do. The official  who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal deliberations  said the ambassadors should not be surprised about being held to a hard end date. The directive has nonetheless upended the personal lives of many ambassadors  who are scrambling to secure living arrangements and acquire visas allowing them to remain in their countries so their children can remain in school  the diplomats said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly on the matter. In Costa Rica  Ambassador Stafford Fitzgerald Haney is hunting for a house or an apartment as his family  —   which includes four   children and his wife  who has been battling breast cancer  —   struggles to figure out how to avoid a move back to the United States with five months left in the school year  according to the diplomats. In the Czech Republic  they said  Ambassador Andrew H. Schapiro is seeking housing in Prague as well as lobbying his children’s   school to break with policy and accept them back midyear. In Brussels and Geneva  Denise Bauer  the United States ambassador to Belgium  and Pamela Hamamoto  the permanent representative to the United Nations  are both trying to find a way to keep daughters from having to move just months before their high school graduation. Ronald E. Neumann  the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy  a   nonprofit association for former ambassadors and senior diplomats  said it was reasonable to expect ambassadors to return at the end of a term  given that they are direct representatives of the president with broad grants of authority. But he could not recall an occasion on which such a strict timeline had been applied. “When you have people out there whose only reason for being an ambassador is their political connection to the outgoing president of a different party  it’s pretty logical to say they should leave ” said Mr. Neumann  a career Foreign Service officer who held ambassadorships in Algeria  Bahrain and Afghanistan. “But I don’t recollect there was ever a guillotine in January where it was just  ‘Everybody out of the pool immediately. ’” W. Robert Pearson  a former ambassador to Turkey and a scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington  said the rule was “quite extraordinary ” adding that it could undermine American interests and signal a hasty change in direction that exacerbates jitters among allies about their relationships with the new administration. With the world already primed to be worrying about such an abrupt change  “this is just a very concrete signal that it is going to happen ” Mr. Pearson said. At a White House farewell reception that Mr. Obama held on Wednesday night for noncareer ambassadors  many of them commiserated  attendees said  comparing notes about how to handle the situation. Some expressed dismay that Mr. Trump  whose wife  Melania  has chosen to stay in New York to avoid moving the couple’s    son  Barron  to a new school midyear  would not ensure that such allowances were made for American ambassadors. They are weighing a direct appeal to Rex W. Tillerson  Mr. Trump’s nominee for secretary of state  or other top transition officials to reconsider the policy. Derek Shearer  a professor of diplomacy at Occidental College who is a former United States ambassador to Finland  said it was difficult to see a rationale for the decision. “It feels like there’s an element just of spite and payback in it ” he said. “I don’t see a higher policy motive. ” The State Department informed all politically appointed ambassadors in a letter the day after the election that they were to submit letters of resignation effective Jan. 20. It instructed those who wanted to seek extensions to submit formal requests explaining their justifications. Incoming presidents of both parties have often made exceptions to allow ambassadors to wrap up personal affairs and important diplomatic business while their successors were in the confirmation process  which can take months. Bill Clinton  George W. Bush and Mr. Obama all granted extensions for a few politically appointed ambassadors. Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell offered particularly wide latitude to ambassadors facing family issues  said Marc Grossman  a longtime diplomat and former top State Department official who is vice chairman of the Cohen Group  a Washington consultancy. “This was something that was important to Secretary Powell because of his own experience living and serving all over the world  so when people asked him  ‘Could I stay another couple of weeks  couple of months my kids are finishing school ’ he was very accommodating ” Mr. Grossman said  adding that his flexibility was an “exception” to the general practice. “He was trying to  I think "WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump lashed out at Democrats on Thursday over their efforts to preserve President Obama’s health care coverage law  insulting their top legislative leader and denouncing the measure as a “lie” as he called for a less expensive and more effective system. “The Democrats  lead by head clown Chuck Schumer  know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in ” Mr. Trump wrote in the first of three   posts on Twitter. The posts arrived the day after Mr. Obama huddled with Democrats on Capitol Hill to strategize over protecting the Affordable Care Act and Vice   Mike Pence met with Republicans about how to gut it. “Instead of working to fix it  they do the typical political thing and BLAME ” Mr. Trump continued on Twitter. “The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning. ‘Keep you doctor  keep your plan! ’” He said it was time for Republicans and Democrats to work together on a “plan that really works  —   much less expensive  FAR BETTER!” The messages could be seen as Mr. Trump’s latest attempt to seize the narrative of the day and deflect attention from a story line less favorable to him. Senate Republicans convened a hearing on Thursday to examine intelligence that the Russians engaged in computer hacking to affect the outcome of the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump has disputed that the Russians were to blame  and he has criticized American intelligence agencies for their work. Mr. Trump also used the social media platform to push back against criticism he attracted on Wednesday for siding with Julian Assange  the WikiLeaks founder  over United States intelligence officials in rejecting Russian responsibility for the hacking. Mr. Trump’s latest Twitter salvo also appeared to be an attempt to mount a political defense of his bid to scrap the law that has provided health care coverage to tens of millions of Americans  as Democrats work to make that effort politically toxic. Mr. Schumer responded later Thursday  saying the   was in a “difficult spot” on the issue. “Instead of calling names ” Mr. Schumer said at a news conference on Capitol Hill  Mr. Trump “should roll up his sleeves and show us a replacement plan that will cover the 20 million Americans who gained coverage  that will cover students or   students  21 to 26  who want to stay on their parents’ plan  that will show how we cover people with   conditions. ” On Wednesday  the   appeared to acknowledge the challenges of doing so without being saddled by voters with a share of blame for the shortcomings of the measure. “Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster  with its poor coverage and massive premium increases ” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday  adding in a separate post: “Don’t let the Schumer clowns out of this web. ” His comments on Thursday came as Mr. Obama took a subtle swipe at the   in a farewell letter  without naming him  writing that Americans never voted for rolling back the health care measure. “What won’t help is taking health care away from 30 million Americans  most of them white and working class denying overtime pay to workers  most of whom have more than earned it or privatizing Medicare and Social Security and letting Wall Street regulate itself again  —   none of which   Americans voted for ” Mr. Obama said in the   letter. As the debate unfolded in Washington  Mr. Trump on Thursday spent more than an hour sitting for a deposition in New York as part of his legal feud with the renowned chef José Andres  whom Mr. Trump is suing for pulling out of a plan to open a new restaurant in his luxury hotel near the White House. Mr. Andres  who is   has said he canceled the project because of Mr. Trump’s disparaging rhetoric about Mexican immigrants during his presidential campaign. Alan Garten  general counsel for the Trump Organization  called the case “fairly straightforward. ” “In short  the parties entered into a valid and enforceable lease  which the tenant clearly breached by walking out and failing to perform its obligations  thereby entitling the landlord to recover damages in the form of unpaid rent  cost of build out  lost profits and other expenses 1.0 "TALLADEGA  Ala.  —   For a band at a tiny    historically black college  it seems in some ways to be the gig of a lifetime: a chance to march and perform at the Jan. 20 presidential inaugural parade in Washington. Some of the musicians at Talladega College have been excited to see the capital for the first time. But because the   is Donald J. Trump  the school has become the subject of an impassioned national outcry  with online petitions  threats to end donations and a flurry of    from alumni who feel that performing in the parade would betray the values of an institution founded by newly freed slaves 150 years ago. On Thursday  after days of speculation that the college administration might bow to the pressure and remove the band from the parade roster  the president of Talladega College  Billy Hawkins  issued a statement confirming the participation of the band  the Marching Tornadoes  and argued  in essence  that the 58th presidential inauguration is about something bigger than Mr. Trump. “We respect and appreciate how our students and alumni feel about our participation in this parade ” Dr. Hawkins said. “As many of those who chose to participate in the parade have said  we feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power. ” Similar issues have been raised about other entertainers scheduled to perform  among them the Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. But because of Talladega’s history  the issues have been especially intense here  with calls for the college to reverse its decision to take part in the festivities. And beyond Talladega  the controversies raise tough questions for Mr. Trump’s most ardent critics as his presidency dawns: What is the proper response to a president as polarizing as Mr. Trump? Should the office of the president be honored  no matter who fills it? Or should there be four years of pure rejection and defiance? And if Mr. Trump’s opponents refuse to participate in his presidency  can critics on the right do the same thing to some other   in the future? To a number of Talladega alumni  the Dec. 30 announcement that the band would march in the parade was an insult to the very principles of the college  which was established two years after the end of the Civil War. The school is affiliated with the United Church of Christ  a liberal Protestant denomination that was deeply involved in the civil rights movement  and for decades it served as an incubator for theories and practices of social justice. Nikky Finney  a poet and Talladega graduate who is now a professor at the University of South Carolina  said in a statement this week that the band should not help celebrate Mr. Trump  who  she said  has maligned women and Mexican immigrants and has proposed barring all Muslims from entering the country. In an interview on Thursday  Ms. Finney  channeling a James Brown lyric  said the college had “sold out the history of Talladega College for chicken change” and “maybe a tin star on a hatemonger’s parade route. ” As of Thursday afternoon  an online petition calling for the band to withdraw from the inaugural parade had attracted more than 1  900 signers  some of them supporters of the college who have threatened to withhold future contributions. But a second petition  which had nearly 300 supporters  argued that the parade was not about politics but “about seeing firsthand the process of a transition” and giving the students a chance to be a part of history. “We are not   thinkers and believe everyone is entitled” to their own beliefs  it stated. “However  we are in support of the United States of America. ” As the debate heated up this week in online forums for students and alumni  the leadership at the private    college hunkered down to consider how best to proceed. The campus police ordered reporters off the   campus. Brief interviews with a few band members on Tuesday evening revealed a group divided. Jerome Haynes  18  a freshman who plays the snare drum  said he hoped politics would not get in the way of an exciting opportunity for the band. In contrast  Ronald Peterson  21  a sophomore who plays cymbals  said he was going to talk to the director about staying home. “I feel that those who are not Republicans should not have to play for it ” he said. On Thursday afternoon  some students said the administration had done the right thing  despite the protests from alumni. Antonio Phillips  24  a senior and a drum major  welcomed the exposure. “We’re musicians  so this is a good platform for us to showcase our talent in front of the world ” he said. His friend Ken Randolph  20  a junior who is not in the band  said the concerns of alumni like Ms. Finney “weigh heavily on the students of Talladega. ” But he said Mr. Trump might benefit from the exposure to a black art form. “This is a part of our culture ” Mr. Randolph said. “With it being on his front doorstep  he might be able to apprehend the vibe and the culture. ” That drama in Talladega  a city of 15  000 about an hour’s drive east of Birmingham  played out as black activists  including the N. A. A. C. P. president  Cornell William Brooks  were arrested on Tuesday in Mobile in a   action at the office of Senator Jeff Sessions  the Alabama Republican nominated to be attorney general in the Trump administration. Mr. Sessions  who is white  was rejected by the Senate for a federal judgeship in 1986 after he was accused of making racially insensitive statements. To some Talladega alumni  the possibility that policies long opposed by   could now be enacted by a   Congress and executive branch was what made the notion of a black band marching for Mr. Trump seem so distasteful. “There’s a great deal of fear in this country that the Voting Rights Act is going to be abolished  that the Affordable Care Act is going to be abolished  that Planned Parenthood is going to be cut off from funding  that Medicaid is going be cut off from funding ” said J. Mason Davis  a Birmingham lawyer who graduated from the college in 1956. “Don’t you understand why we have a fear of the man?” Donavon Jackson  24  a former trumpet player in the band who graduated last year  said performing as part of the inauguration would be particularly special for a college of about 1  000 students whose band program is only about five years old. The school does not have a football team  which makes parade invitations all the more important. “I’m honored to go to a school that can say they marched in an inauguration parade ” said Mr. Jackson  who received a chemistry degree and now lives in Houston. “Not necessarily for the person  —   and that’s not necessarily saying he’s a bad person. ” In the statement on Thursday  school officials said they still faced the “challenge” of raising more than $60  000 to cover expenses for the trip. The population of the city of Talladega is divided about evenly between blacks and whites  and to a visitor  it can feel like a place where racial harmony and discord coexist on seemingly parallel planes. Whites speak with pride about the historic black college downtown  —   though one white person was overheard on Wednesday warning of a liberal plot to foment a “race war” so that President Obama might declare martial law before the inauguration. While some residents said the band should stay home  and others said it should attend the event in Washington  a few spoke harshly of Mr. Trump while hoping the inauguration would help the band get noticed  —   something the city  which was bypassed by the interstate highway system  has struggled with in recent decades. Bonquita McClellan  26  manages her father’s restaurant  Big Mac’s Open Pit BBQ  near campus. Ms. McClellan  who is black  said the disdain for Mr. Trump among her   peers was universal. “If anybody would have had us in concentration camps ” she said  “it’d be him. ” But she also said the band should go and make a name for itself in the nation’s capital. “How often ” she asked  “does Talladega College get a chance to play for the president?” Up the street at a real estate office near the   courthouse  Randy and Heather Roberts  a white couple who voted for Mr. Trump  raved about the Talladega College band and its performance at the Dec. 5 Christmas parade. Ms. Roberts showed a video of the band on her phone. “They were phenomenal ” Ms. Roberts said. Ms. Roberts  41  said she grew up with black and white friends. Mr. Roberts  48  said he and his wife were pleased to cater to their multiracial clientele. But when they spoke about politics  the couple sounded like people who knew something was broken but did not know how it might be fixed. “It is not going to be pleasant for the next four years "After more than five years of investigations and negotiations  the curious case of MF Global is finally closed. On Thursday  federal regulators announced a $5 million settlement with Jon S. Corzine  who ran MF Global when it collapsed into bankruptcy in 2011 and lost more than $1 billion in customer money. The settlement  reached unanimously at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the waning days of the Obama administration and approved by a federal judge this week  caps a   spectacle that derailed Mr. Corzine’s career and spurred a number of congressional  criminal and regulatory investigations. The regulatory case arose in 2013  when the commodities agency sued Mr. Corzine  a Democratic former New Jersey senator and governor  saying he had failed to “diligently supervise” the firm as it jeopardized the clients’ accounts. The agency did not directly link Mr. Corzine  70  to the missing money  but it did accuse a   employee in Chicago  Edith O’Brien  of “aiding and abetting” the misuse of customer money  saying she allowed it to be used to plug holes in MF Global’s own accounts. To resolve the case  Mr. Corzine has agreed to pay the $5 million penalty out of his own pocket. While the sum is manageable for someone who reaped many millions of dollars as a top Goldman Sachs executive before pursuing a career in politics  it is an unusual step. In other federal cases involving Wall Street  insurance money often covers settlement amounts  sparing the executives themselves. While Mr. Corzine was willing to settle the case  Ms. O’Brien nearly took it to trial. But in recent weeks she  too  agreed to settle  striking a deal that has imposed a $500  000 penalty and an   prohibition on her associating with a futures broker like MF Global. Mr. Corzine agreed to a harsher undertaking  —   accepting a lifetime prohibition from leading a futures broker or registering with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In effect  that means he will not personally trade other people’s money in the futures industry  except for smaller trades under certain threshold limits. Mr. Corzine  in theory  could still operate a hedge fund that does futures trading  and he could trade for his own account. The settlement also does not prevent him from trading in other markets. “This resolution demonstrates the importance that the commission attaches to customer protection  which has long been a hallmark of our mission ” Aitan Goelman  the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission enforcement division  said in a statement announcing the settlement. The settlements  the contours of which were reported by The New York Times in October  bring a   close to the MF Global ordeal. The criminal investigations ended with the conclusion that MF Global employees did not intentionally break the law. Just last year  Mr. Corzine settled much of the private MF Global litigation. And a trustee has long recovered the missing customer money (much of it wound up at MF Global’s banks and clearinghouses) and made whole the farmers and hedge funds whose accounts were raided in the firm’s final days. In a statement on Thursday  Mr. Corzine said  “As the C. E. O. of MF Global in 2011  I have accepted responsibility for its failure  and I deeply regret the impact it had on customers  employees  shareholders and others. ” He added: “I remain gratified that several years ago all customer money was recovered and returned to MF Global customers. ” His lawyer  Andrew J. Levander  said: “Mr. Corzine has given more than 10 days of testimony under oath  and these matters have been investigated exhaustively by two U. S. attorney’s offices  the F. B. I. the S. E. C. the C. F. T. C. Finra and Congress. ” (Finra is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.) And yet  Mr. Levander said  “None of these investigations have led to allegations that Mr. Corzine engaged in any kind of intentional misconduct or fraud  or that he was at any time not truthful in his many hours of testimony. ” The case also concludes a   political challenge for the commodities agency  which came under fire for not preventing a breach of customer money at a firm it regulated. Compounding the pressure  Mr. Corzine was a sensitive target  a prominent Democrat who has been a confidant of leaders in Washington and on Wall Street. Against that backdrop  the agency extracted the $5 million payout from Mr. Corzine  a sum far greater than what it could have expected to win if he had been found liable at trial. During negotiations with Mr. Corzine last year  the commission also strengthened aspects of the deal after some of the agency’s commissioners questioned it  The New York Times reported at the time. The case against Mr. Corzine was among the agency’s biggest enforcement actions in the Obama administration. And after MF Global’s demise  on Halloween in 2011  the commodities agency used the episode to tighten the rules for protecting customer money. The disappearance of the money from MF Global unnerved the futures industry and raised broader concerns about the safety of customer funds across Wall Street. Further review showed that MF Global’s financial straits left it vulnerable to a breach. Mr. Corzine joined MF Global as chief executive and chairman in 2010 after the firm had lost money in each of the previous three years. In hopes of returning the firm to profitability  —   and perhaps transforming it into a miniature Goldman Sachs  —   Mr. Corzine placed a large wager on European sovereign debt at a time when investors feared defaults in the eurozone. Although his bet ultimately would have been profitable for MF Global  and the European bonds paid out for other firms that bought the debt  it was not enough to save the firm from unrelated woes. MF Global’s auditor  for example  made the firm write down the value of a significant future tax benefit  a move that appeared to unnerve MF Global’s investors as well as ratings agencies. And after a series of ratings downgrades  the firm started to unravel. In MF Global’s final days  it overdrew an account at JPMorgan Chase  one of its banks  and scrambled to patch that hole. That is when the improper transfers of customer money accelerated  according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s complaint. Minutes after learning of the overdrawn account  Mr. Corzine told Ms. O’Brien that meeting the bank’s demands was “the most important thing” she could get “done that day. ” Ultimately  in the chaos and confusion of those final days  customer money was transferred to JPMorgan. And yet  Mr. Corzine was not accused of instructing Ms. O’Brien to use customer money for this purpose. According to court records submitted by his lawyers  Mr. Corzine was not told that the firm was at risk of violating the rules until the eve of the bankruptcy  after the breach had happened. In an email  Ms. O’Brien told Mr. Corzine that the transfer to JPMorgan was a “house wire ” meaning it came from the firm’s accounts. In the years since  Mr. Corzine has visited Central America for a humanitarian project and has traded with his own money. His philanthropic efforts have included working with Covenant House  a nonprofit focused on helping homeless children. “With this matter resolved ” he said  “I am eager to move forward and plan to spend my time focused on issues that have always been important in my life: my family  community and philanthropic causes "The question from the analyst on Thursday was delicate enough. In agreeing to buy the Craftsman tool brand from Sears Holdings  how would Stanley Black  Decker protect itself from legal issues that could arise at the seller down the line? But the response from Stanley Black  Decker’s chief executive  James M. Loree  acknowledged a concern that many on the conference call were likely to have harbored: that Sears could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection someday. “We expect to get this approved before there is any indication whatsoever that there would be any restructuring of that nature from Sears ” Mr. Loree said  adding that he believed such a move was not imminent. The sale of Craftsman  valued at more than $775 million  was meant to prevent that day of reckoning by raising   cash for Sears. For Sears  selling one of its classic brands  —   one it created nearly a century ago  —   is the latest move to bolster its balance sheet during a prolonged sales slump. Edward S. Lampert  the chairman and chief executive of Sears  has struggled for years to find  ways to help the company  as much through esoteric financial maneuvers as through operational fixes. These have been tough times for retailers. Macy’s and Kohl’s said this week that their holiday sales were weaker than expected. Macy’s also announced plans to cut more than 10  000 jobs and close 100 stores. Sears also suffered during the season  with   sales at its Sears and Kmart units down at least 12 percent. Sears has been in trouble far longer. Under Mr. Lampert  who is also a hedge fund manager  Sears has consistently lagged behind its peers  as analysts said  pointing to underinvestment in stores and slumping sales. Last September  analysts at Moody’s estimated that the company’s negative cash flow for its 2016 fiscal year would be $1. 5 billion. As of Oct. 29  Sears had $258 million in cash and equivalents on hand  compared with $3. 1 billion in   debt  the company said. Its market value Thursday morning  by comparison  was $1. 2 billion  even with a jump in its stock price after the Craftsman news. Sears shares surged as much as 8 percent on Thursday  before ending up 0. 3 percent on a day when some retail stocks tumbled. Sears has long been dogged by predictions that it would eventually be forced into bankruptcy. But on Thursday  the company listed its latest initiatives for shoring up its cash position  including closing 150 more stores and raising up to $1 billion through a $500 million loan backed by its real estate and a previously announced loan from Mr. Lampert’s hedge fund. “We are taking strong  decisive actions today to stabilize the company and improve our financial flexibility in what remains a challenging retail environment ” Mr. Lampert  the company’s biggest shareholder  said in a statement. Stanley Black  Decker will be able to sell Craftsman tools in even more outlets. Today  only 10 percent of the product lineup is sold outside Sears stores. “Craftsman is a legendary American brand ” Mr. Loree said in a statement. “This agreement represents a significant opportunity to grow the market. ” Reaching the deal took months  as Mr. Loree acknowledged on the analyst call. Last spring  Sears announced that it had hired the banks Citigroup and LionTree as advisers to explore the sale of some of its   brands  including Craftsman  DieHard and Kenmore  to raise money. Stanley Black  Decker was one of several dozens of companies approached during the summer about bidding on the tool business. But after the company and its bankers at Deutsche Bank spent time devising a potential takeover bid  Stanley Black  Decker turned its eyes toward buying Newell Brands’ tool business  a deal announced in October. By late fall  however  Sears returned to ask if Stanley Black  Decker would reconsider a bid for Craftsman. Under the deal  Stanley Black  Decker will pay $525 million when the transaction closes  which is expected to occur by   and an additional $250 million at the end of the third year after closing. Sears will also collect a percentage of new Craftsman sales for 15 years after the deal closes. The transaction is now valued at $900 million. “We literally spent months putting this transaction together and to cover each other’s needs and manage the risk profile for both parties 1.0 "A Long Island Rail Road train that crashed in Brooklyn on Wednesday was going more than twice the speed limit when it slammed into a train station  injuring more than 100 people  federal investigators said on Thursday. The train was traveling at more than 10 miles per hour when it hit the end of the tracks at Atlantic Terminal  where the speed limit is 5 m. p. h. said Ted Turpin  an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. He said that federal officials were investigating the crash and had not yet determined the cause. The train rammed into a bumping block during the morning rush  striking a room beyond the track and causing the first two cars to derail. The accident was reminiscent of a deadly crash in September in which a New Jersey Transit train plowed into Hoboken Terminal  killing a woman and injuring over 100 people. (That train was also traveling over twice the speed limit there when it crashed.) On Thursday  Mr. Turpin said the engineer who was operating the Long Island Rail Road train told investigators he could not remember the crash. “He does recall entering into the station and controlling the speed of the train ” Mr. Turpin said at a news conference. “But then the next thing he realized was after the collision. ” Investigators have not released the engineer’s name  but Mr. Turpin said that he was 50 and had started as an engineer at the railroad in 1999. The engineer had started working around midnight on Tuesday and was nearing the end of his shift at the time of the crash  Mr. Turpin said. In the Hoboken crash  the engineer  Thomas Gallagher  also said he did not remember the crash. His lawyer later said that Mr. Gallagher had an undiagnosed sleep disorder and discovered after the crash that he had severe sleep apnea  which disrupts sleep and may cause excessive daytime sleepiness. The engineer of the Long Island Rail Road train has been tested for drugs  but the results were not available  federal investigators said on Thursday. The engineer told investigators that he was not using his cellphone at the time of the crash. Federal investigators said they planned on Friday to interview a conductor and an assistant conductor who were also on the train. They also intend to interview two railroad employees who witnessed the crash. Mr. Turpin noted that a safety technology  known as positive train control  was not in place on the tracks where the crash happened  even though it was possible that the technology could have slowed the train. Officials from the safety board have long called for railroads to install the system to help prevent train accidents  though Mr. Turpin noted it was not required in train terminals. Nearly two years ago
