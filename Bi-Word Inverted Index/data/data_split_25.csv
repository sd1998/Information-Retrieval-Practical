"BAGHDAD  —   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market  killing at least 36 people hours after President François Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers  a police officer said  adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande  Haider   Iraq’s prime minister  said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around  he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State  also known as ISIS or ISIL  claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad  underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year  including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City  a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003   invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit  vegetables and laborers’ shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim  28  an owner of a nearby cellphone store  described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomber’s vehicle  trying to get hired. “Then a big boom came  sending them up into the air ” said Mr. Hashim  who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed “the most ineffective security forces in the world” for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government  even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month  the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capital’s six million residents. “We have no idea who will kill at any moment and who’s supposed to protect us ” said Ali Abbas  a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. “If the securities forces can’t protect us  then allow us to do the job. ” Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70  according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately  the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a “  incident ” without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum  and later traveled to the   northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul "SYDNEY  Australia  —   The annual beach pilgrimage during the height of summer in Melbourne  Australia’s   city  is threatened by an unsettling phenomenon: shores where the tides are tainted with excrement. The Environment Protection Authority in the state of Victoria said on Monday that heavy rains had caused fecal pollution to wash into Port Phillip from rivers  creeks and drains. It advised against swimming at 21 beaches because of poor water quality. “It’s poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem ” said Anthony Boxshall  the agency’s manager of applied sciences  noting that the waste was coming from people  dogs  horses  cows  birds and other animals. Fecal pollution can cause serious health problems  including gastroenteritis. Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the   Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip  affecting the city’s bayside beaches the most. The agency  which takes regular water samples  rates beaches. A “good” rating means that the water is suitable for swimming. “Fair” means that rainfall has affected the water. “Poor” means people should avoid it. Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual. “When the temperature gets above 86 Fahrenheit  Melbournians typically pack the family in the car with food and drink and spend the day at the beach ” said Sam Riley  who lives in the city. “I was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer 1.0 "When the Green Bay Packers lost to the Washington Redskins in Week 11  dropping to   Aaron Rodgers vowed to “run the table” in a march to the playoffs. With a   victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night  the team fulfilled Rodgers’ promise. Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants  thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams  but the N. F. C. North bragging rights  and a home game in the first round of the playoffs  were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the team’s sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit. Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams. But when all was said and done  ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order. No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time: 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The Seahawks’ title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg. After the injury  the Seahawks went   with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the   Rams and 49ers. That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions  who lost their final three games  blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay. Line: Seahawks   ( : 43) No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay Packers Time: 4:40 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East  home of the   Dallas Cowboys  the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the   record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a   Packers squad that won its final six games. The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs  they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times. Line: Packers   ( : 44. 5) Bye weeks: Dallas  Atlanta No. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston Texans Time: 4:35 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line: Texans   ( : 37) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. ’s division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage  whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler  was forced to leave Week 17’s loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds  it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16  Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17  and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston. No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time: 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the team’s quarterback  Ryan Tannehill  was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore  and Jay Ajayi  the team’s   running back  they won two of three games and secured a   berth. But going up against a   offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for Miami’s middling defense  even if Tannehill’s knee heals enough to allow him to return. Line: Steelers  .5 ( : 47. 5) Bye weeks: New England  Kansas City With four teams vying for two N. F. C. playoff spots  all eyes were on the   game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings  with the Lions and Packers playing a     evening matchup. The Giants  who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain  threw a wrench in the Redskins’ plans  eliminating their division rivals with a decisive   victory. With the drama essentially taken out of the N. F. C. all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A. F. C. where there was a   at the top of the standings in the A. F. C. West. Just a week after losing Derek Carr  the team’s quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player  to a broken leg  the Oakland Raiders were crushed   by the Denver Broncos. That  combined with the Kansas City Chiefs’   victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a   spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. which comes with a   bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders  who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a   team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a   quarterback under center as Carr’s backup  Matt McGloin  injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos. Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No.   in the A. F. C. it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A. F. C. with a win over Miami  the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N. F. C. before their loss to Philadelphia  and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N. F. C. with a   win over New Orleans. The only remaining chance for a minor   was for the Packers  who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker  to lose to the Lions  which would have forced them to play on the road in the   round of the playoffs. But the    aspect of the de facto N. F. C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants  which eliminated the Redskins from   contention. While most of the races were straight forward  one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers  having the Redskins tie the Giants  the Packers lose to the Lions  and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis  Dallas  Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day "Mariah Carey suffered through a performance train wreck in Times Square on New Year’s Eve as malfunctions left her at a loss vocally during her hit song “Emotions ” struggling to reach notes and to sync the lyrics and music. The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her   numbers  “We Belong Together ” while a recording of the song continued to play  a confirmation that she had been  . But on Sunday  a dispute erupted between Ms. Carey’s representatives and producers of ABC’s “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest ” on which the singer was performing. Ms. Carey’s manager  Stella Bulochnikov  charged that the show’s producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them  —   and chose to continue showing Ms. Carey’s messy performance “to get ratings. ” “I will never know the truth  but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production ” Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday. “I’m certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate. It is what it is: New Year’s Eve in Times Square. Mariah did them a favor. She was the biggest star there  and they did not have their” act together. Dick Clark Productions  which produced the show  issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Carey’s performance woes had nothing to do with the production  and that any suggestion that the company “would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory  outrageous and frankly absurd. ” “In very rare instances  there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television ” the statement said  adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company “had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey’s New Year’s Eve performance. ” A veteran audio producer  Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International  a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years  also said in an email that there had been no malfunctions with the sound equipment he oversaw. “Every monitor and   device worked perfectly ” Mr. Goldstein said. “ I can’t comment beyond that and don’t know what her nontechnical issue may have been. ” A spokeswoman for Ms. Carey said on Sunday that the singer was not at fault for her performance. “Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances ” the spokeswoman  Nicole Perna  told The Associated Press. It was a rare meltdown on national television by one of the   recording artists of all time. Ms. Carey  a pop phenomenon in the 1990s who won five Grammys out of 34 nominations over the years  was the final   act on ABC’s “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest. ” She had just finished “Auld Lang Syne” when her star turn began to spiral out of control. “We can’t hear ” she said in the opening seconds of “Emotions” after she sashayed down the stage before more than one million people who had gathered to watch the ball drop in Manhattan. Standing still with her left hand on her hip while music played  Ms. Carey told the audience that there had not been a proper sound check before her performance. Then she said  “We’ll just sing ” and noted proudly of her song  “It went to No. 1. ” But she could not manage the notes that followed  and she either forgot lyrics or did not want to deliver a subpar performance. “We’re missing some of these vocals  but it is what it is ” she said. “Let the audience sing. ” ABC quickly cut to shots of the Times Square crowd as Ms. Carey tried to perform some of her choreography. She continued suggesting fixes from the stage  and at one point seemed to defend herself. “I’m trying to be a good sport here ” she said. When the number ended  the crowd cheered her on. “That was  —   ” she said  pausing for effect  “amazing. ” She seemed to recover at first with “We Belong Together ” but there appeared to be another malfunction  and Ms. Carey again stopped singing. But this time  the prerecorded number kept playing. “It just don’t get any better ” she said  and then left the stage. The cause of the problem was not immediately clear. After the performance  Ms. Carey posted a mildly profane slang phrase on Twitter with an “upset” emoji 1.0 "PARIS  —   When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March  Yves Ubelmann got a call from Syria’s director of antiquities to come over in a hurry. An architect by training  Mr. Ubelmann  36  had worked in Syria before the country was engulfed by war. But now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects  mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in Paris: producing digital copies of threatened historical sites. Palmyra  parts of it already destroyed by the Islamists who deemed these monuments idolatrous  was still rigged with explosives. So he and Houmam Saad  his Syrian colleague  spent four days flying a drone with a robot camera over the crumbled arches and temples. “Drones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details  every crack and hole  and we can take very precise measurements ” said Mr. Ubelmann  who founded the company Iconem. “This is the stuff architects and archaeologists need. ” They need it in a new push for virtual preservation that scientists  archaeologists and others  like Mr. Ubelmann  are compiling on a large scale. The records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored  repaired or reconstructed. Of special interest today are ancient sites in Syria  and also Iraq  that have suffered from war  looting and the Islamic State. “Palmyra was very difficult ” Mr. Ubelmann said. “The terrorists were uploading videos with them blowing up monuments and smashing statues to manipulate public opinion ” he said. “We felt the best response was to magnify the pictures of these places and show their splendor and their importance to the culture. It became a war of images. ” The latest front in that war is in the exhibition halls of the Grand Palais in Paris  where  through Jan. 9  many of the 40  000 images he and his team took at Palmyra have become the basis for displays. Called “Eternal Sites: From Bamiyan to Palmyra ” the show aims to draw attention to the rising threats to global heritage. To underscore the exhibition’s political importance  it was opened several weeks ago by President François Hollande of France  who described it as “an act of resistance” against terror and intolerance. Showing the beauty of the Middle Eastern heritage  he said  “is the best answer to the Islamist propaganda of hate  destruction and death. ”   Martinez  the director of the Louvre and the lead curator of the show  said the sites had been chosen because “all are under threat from pillaging  neglect or destruction and are not accessible to the public. ” He said it aimed to mobilize public opinion “in the face of the devastation of unique heritage. ” Besides images from Palmyra  the multimedia show projects enormous   photographs and videos  immersing visitors in different eras  including the ancient Iraqi city of Khorsabad around 700 B. C. an   mosque in Damascus and a medieval Christian citadel. Mr. Ubelmann dismissed any criticism of collaboration with the government of the Syrian president  Bashar  . “We were working pro bono  not for any government  but to help the archaeologists ” he said. They shared their work with the Syrian archaeologists  he said  adding  “We also train our colleagues so they can later do this on their own. ” What is paramount is memory and potential restoration. In the last year  his team has flown drones over some 20 historic sites in Syria. Recently  it moved into   zones in Iraq  close to the front line in the fight against the Islamic State. The team is now analyzing the war’s effects on the remains of once thriving cities dating back some 3  000 years  including Nineveh  Khorsabad and the thrashed temple and palace of Nimrud  where the government drove out the jihadists in November. In 2015  Islamists sent out videos showing militants using sledgehammers to break reliefs of human figures and mythical winged bulls as part of their   campaign. “Nimrud was probably the most splendid of the Assyrian cities ” Layla Abdulkarim  a Syrian architect  said as she analyzed aerial photographs. Using drones in archaeological work is not entirely new  specialists say  but at a recent gathering in Paris researchers from Europe and the Middle East said they were now having to practice “war archaeology ” that is  collecting reliable data from   areas. The images from the drones in war zones had proved immensely valuable. But these were barely scratching the surface. Before the war  close to 150 archaeological projects were underway  just in Syria  researchers said. Experts from many countries are trying to assess the damage in Syria’s old cities but also in the area where the Islamic State held sway that is straddling Iraq and Syria  the region that is seen as central to human history and often called the birthplace of modern economics and writing. There is an outcry for data about the havoc wreaked in Yemen by Saudi bombing. “People are exchanging satellite images and data on blogs and other research platforms  but we have no real assessment yet because so many ancient sites are not accessible ” said Pascal Butterlin  a professor of archaeology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Time is of the essence  even in the case of    ruins  Mr. Butterlin said. He has led expeditions for more than 20 years to Mari  near Syria’s border with Iraq. Before fleeing  the guards at Mari reported that looters had come from Iraq  he said. “We need to know what places need to be stabilized and how looters have altered the sites ” he said. “Important evidence  like clandestine pits  can disappear very quickly through sandstorms and erosion. ” Cheikhmous Ali  a Syrian archaeologist based in France  who founded the international group the Association for the Protection of Syrian Archaeology  said reports of organized pillaging continued. A first wave of looting began in 2012  Mr. Ali said  and looting has accelerated since 2014 with the arrival of the Islamic State. While jihadists were more motivated to destroy the artifacts  they had also allowed looters to operate in exchange for money. Mr. Ali said he kept an ever changing tally of museums bombed  objects carted off  safes stolen. The exhibition in Paris  which is drawing large crowds  coincides with “History Begins in Mesopotamia ” a show at the Louvre’s regional museum in Lens. Both exhibitions highlight the French government’s active concern about cultural damage in Syria  which was briefly controlled by France in the first half of the 20th century. Mr. Hollande has taken a strong interest  condemning the deliberate destruction of patrimony by all sides as “war crimes. ” This past month  France offered $30 million toward a proposed $100 million fund to protect sites as fighting abates  provide emergency storage for artifacts and eventually rehabilitate monuments. At the “Eternal Sites” opening at the Grand Palais  Mr. Hollande stressed that France was taking in more Syrian refugees trying to protect monuments of great historical and cultural importance did not mean ignoring the suffering of the population. “Should we be concerned about the patrimony?” he asked. “What is more important  saving lives or saving stones? In reality
