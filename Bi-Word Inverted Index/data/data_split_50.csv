"In 2007  Rey Canunayon and his wife  MaryGwen  immigrated to the United States from the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. In doing so  they were fulfilling their family’s dreams. For years  her parents had requested that the Canunayons join them in New York City. But her parents died before that could happen. Mr. Canunayon felt remorse about not honoring their wishes while they were alive. Still  he and his wife wanted to embark on the adventure and make the move. “America is a great nation  a kind nation  a nation of greener pastures and milk and honey and endless possibilities ” Mr. Canunayon said. When the couple arrived  they stayed with Ms. Canunayon’s family in New Jersey. Life was exciting  even relaxing  Mr. Canunayon said. But as they settled in a new country  he struggled to find work and grew despondent. “Oh  my God  I have cried a river because I was in a depression ” said Mr. Canunayon  now 46. He found relaxation riding the subway  one station to the next  so long as it kept moving. “When you come from a place where you are so familiar  your own country  you have friends  relatives  connections  a career. And then you’re stripped of everything except your dignity it’s really hard ” he said. Eventually  the couple were able to move into an apartment of their own in Elmhurst  Queens. They also secured employment. He works at a   laundry  while his wife  49  is a babysitter  a midwife and a nanny. In October 2015  they received their green cards. Beyond that  Mr. Canunayon  who left a career in nonprofit work in the Philippines  has recommitted himself to working to help people and neighborhoods change for the better. Only this time  he is not collecting a paycheck for it. “God gave knowledge for free  skills for free  talent for free  so I’ll give it for free ” Mr. Canunayon said. He volunteers at the couple’s place of worship in Elmhurst  St. Adalbert Roman Catholic Church. He also helps other Filipino immigrants. “I cannot imagine myself not sharing the skills and   talent that I have ” he said. But because this effort doesn’t come with a salary  it doesn’t help pay the bills. It took one episode  when the Canunayons received a $600 medical bill for lab tests in September  for them to plummet into financial instability. “It was a big problem  Mr. Canunayon said. “What will happen to us if we can’t pay the rent?” He came across a possible solution on one of his volunteer outings for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Filipino Consulate  where he was helping people renew their passports. He mentioned his financial problems to Greg Hankins  a volunteer he had met that day. Mr. Hankins encouraged him to contact another group  Community Health Advocates. It is operated by the Community Service Society  one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Community Service Society did help  providing $641. 45 in Neediest Cases money to cover the couple’s outstanding medical bills. They also got help obtaining health insurance. While grateful for the assistance  they continue to worry about everyday challenges: making ends meet  sending money back to their families and carefully monitoring their finances. “It’s the same situation  financially struggling and trying to get myself back into the saddle ” Mr. Canunayon said. He continues to search for jobs in the nonprofit sector. In the Philippines  he worked in research  advocacy and policy legislation  which led to the development of sustainable organic agriculture to feed the poor. The cause was personal: Many members of his family are farmers. He has not given up hope that he will find a job that lets him continue his passion for service while providing a decent income. “I would be killing myself if I did something else ” he said. “It would deplete my energy. When you work on the things you most love doing 2017.0 1.0 "WASHINGTON  —   It was supposed to be a triumphant morning for Republicans on Capitol Hill  —   a moment to demonstrate the merits of unified party rule in the age of Donald J. Trump. By noon  party leaders had a message for their charges: It was not going smoothly. The day after House Republicans voted to eliminate an independent ethics body  members returned to work on Tuesday to find their offices inundated with angry missives from constituents amid a national uproar. By midmorning  Mr. Trump had weighed in  questioning the members’ priorities on Twitter. Shortly after  lawmakers were summoned to the basement of the Capitol for a hastily convened meeting with Republican leaders. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the majority leader  —   who  along with Speaker Paul D. Ryan  had opposed the proposal  —   lobbed a pointed question at his fellow Republicans  according to two people present: Had they campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act  or tinkering with an ethics office? Minutes later  members emerged to say the changes had been scrapped. The reversal came less than 24 hours after House Republicans  meeting in a secret session  voted to curtail the powers of the Office of Congressional Ethics  an independent body created in 2008 after a series of scandals involving House lawmakers  including three who were sent to jail. It was part of a turbulent opening for the Trump era in Washington  marked by a Republican push in the Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans  led by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia  had sought on Monday to prevent the office from pursuing investigations that might result in criminal charges. Instead  they wanted to allow lawmakers on the more powerful House Ethics Committee to shut down inquiries. They even sought to block the small staff at the Office of Congressional Ethics  which would have been renamed and put under the oversight of House lawmakers  from speaking to the news media. “It has damaged or destroyed a lot of political careers in this place  and it’s cost members of Congress millions of dollars to defend themselves against anonymous allegations ” Representative Steve King  Republican of Iowa  said Tuesday  still defending the move. But such resolve crumbled Tuesday morning  as thousands of phone calls flooded lawmakers’ offices and both conservative and liberal ethics groups issued statements condemning the vote. Some Republicans joined in  saying the measure sent the wrong message to the public. (Internet searches for the words “Who is my representative” surged after news of the plan broke Monday night and peaked Tuesday morning  according to Google.) “It was a stumble ” said Representative Mark Sanford  Republican of South Carolina  who opposed the measure and who was himself the subject of an ethics investigation while he was governor of South Carolina. “Probably not the way you want to start out. ” Mr. Trump had weighed in via a series of Twitter posts  suggesting that the House should be focused on domestic policy priorities such as health care and a tax overhaul. He called the Office of Congressional Ethics “unfair” but said focusing on it now was a case of misplaced priorities. He appended the hashtag “DTS ” an apparent allusion to his promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy had made clear on Monday that they  too  were opposed to the change. But amid boxes of pizza at a House office building  with the Rose Bowl playing on a nearby television  several members voiced support for the maneuver  including Representative Steve Pearce of New Mexico  whose office employed an aide who was ensnared in an ethics inquiry but later cleared. At first  on Tuesday morning  Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy played down the changes. Mr. McCarthy suggested that he and Mr. Ryan did not have the power to simply order other Republicans to take their advice. “Welcome back ” he joked  referring to the start of the new session of Congress on Tuesday. Even at home  he said  “I usually don’t win what we watch on TV. ” About an hour later  before new members of Congress were to be sworn in  —   the point when the House adopts new rules that will govern how it conducts itself during the   session  —   Mr. McCarthy told his fellow Republicans that they needed to reverse themselves quickly  or potentially face an even more embarrassing revolt on the House floor. By his estimation  he told them  the provision was going to be removed one way or another. This was not the first time that House lawmakers  —   Democrats or Republicans  —   had tried to curtail the powers or budget of the Office of Congressional Ethics  which some lawmakers see as being too aggressive in its investigations  even though it is routinely cheered by nonprofit ethics groups on both the left and the right. Perhaps most prominently  in 2011  Representative Melvin Watt  a North Carolina Democrat who later left Congress to join the Obama administration  tried to cut the agency’s budget by 40 percent  a proposal that failed on a   vote. The House Ethics Committee  the only body that has the power to actually punish lawmakers  also frequently clashed with the office  which serves more as a grand jury that investigates allegations and issues findings to the Ethics Committee of probable cause of misdeeds. For example  the committee tried in 2015 to force the Office of Congressional Ethics to shut down its investigation into allegations that nine House lawmakers’ trips to Azerbaijan in 2013 had been improperly paid for  in part  by a foreign government entity. Some of the lawmakers also accepted improper gifts during the trips  including rugs and crystal. The Office of Congressional Ethics refused to shut down its inquiry  and it published its findings on its own after the Ethics Committee voted to clear the lawmakers of wrongdoing (although the committee urged them to return the gifts). House rules require the Ethics Committee to act on recommendations by the Office of Congressional Ethics within 90 days  with the expectation that it will either formally clear the targeted lawmakers or create investigative committees to determine if rules or laws have been violated. But in recent years  the committee has increasingly relied on a loophole that allows it to informally continue to review allegations without closing a case  a step it has taken in 21 of the 68 cases referred since 2009. Most frequently  that means an end to the matter  at least as far as the public is aware  even though the Ethics Committee never formally announces that it has closed the investigation. As of this week  cases in such a limbo include allegations against Representatives Mark Meadows  Republican of North Carolina Roger Williams  Republican of Texas Markwayne Mullin  Republican of Oklahoma Cathy McMorris Rodgers  Republican of Washington Bobby L. Rush  Democrat of Illinois and Luis V. Gutiérrez  Democrat of Illinois. After their reversal on Tuesday  House Republicans agreed to ask the Ethics Committee to examine the Office of Congressional Ethics and recommend possible changes by this summer to address the concerns that some members have raised. Mr. Goodlatte  who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  defended his proposal and called the reporting about it inaccurate. “Gross misrepresentation by opponents of my amendment  and the media willing to go along with this agenda  resulted in a flurry of misconceptions and unfounded claims about the true purpose of this amendment ” he said in a statement. But Mr. Goodlatte’s critics said he had simply been caught trying to sneak through a favor to help protect his fellow lawmakers. “We’re glad that the House Republicans listened to the public outrage about this proposal and came to their senses to reverse it  and not end real ethics enforcement in Congress ” Noah Bookbinder  executive director of the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington 2017.0 1.0 " (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Congress focuses on health care. Debate begins today on legislation to dismantle major parts of the Affordable Care Act. President Obama is scheduled to meet with Democrats about resisting efforts to repeal the law  while Vice   Mike Pence will meet with lawmakers from his party to gird them for a fight. • Rough first day back. Republican lawmakers abandoned on Monday a move to eliminate an ethics office after rebukes from constituents and from   Donald J. Trump. Our writer says Mr. Trump’s intervention raises “alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. ” • Trump on trade. The  ’s pick for trade representative  Robert Lighthizer  is a longtime advocate of protectionist policies  a choice in line with Mr. Trump’s focus on making products in America. That effort has made some Republicans uneasy  but some Democrats are ready to support it. Earlier on Tuesday  Mr. Trump criticized General Motors for making cars in Mexico. Hours later  Ford said it would expand production at a Michigan factory and would drop plans for a new plant in Mexico. • Getting ready for legal fights.  Democratic leaders of the California Legislature have hired the former U. S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to represent them in any legal fights against the White House.

This month  Melania Trump  —   born Melanija Knavs in Slovenia  —   will become the second first lady to have been born outside the U. S. Louisa Adams  the wife of John Quincy Adams (president from 1825 to 1829) was the first. She was born in London in 1775. Her mother was English  her father the American consul. Their home became an essential stop for American visitors  including the future president  who met Louisa in 1795 and married her in 1797. Louisa arrived in the U. S. in 1801  when President John Adams brought his diplomat son home for a time. Wherever the couple was posted  her engaging personality stood out. Louisa dazzled imperial courts overseas  and her soirees were the heart of Washington’s social life when her husband was secretary of state  proving to be crucial to his ascension to the presidency. The question of her “Americanness” became an issue during his tumultuous term in office. Her efforts to defend herself only drew more attention to her background. Louisa continued to be a political partner to her husband as he served in Congress after leaving the White House  supporting his antislavery efforts. When she died in 1852 "WASHINGTON  —   The   Congress opened the turbulent Trump era in Washington on Tuesday  as the new Senate moved instantly to begin the repeal of President Obama’s signature health care law while the House descended into chaos in an   attempt to gut an independent congressional ethics office. On a day usually reserved for pomp  constitutionally mandated procedure and small children parading around in fancy dresses  Congress instead pitched itself into partisan battles. Speaker Paul D. Ryan easily won   but not before the embarrassment of having his members defy him by voting to eliminate the ethics office  only to then abandon that effort after a flood of criticism from constituents and Twitter messages from   Donald J. Trump that criticized House Republican priorities. It was a rocky start to a period in which Republicans had promised an end to Washington gridlock if they controlled both Congress and the White House. There was intraparty conflict and a sense that Mr. Trump  who ran against the Republican establishment  would continue to be openly critical of his own party at times. As Democrats in both chambers seethed  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  unveiled the legislative language that could decimate the Affordable Care Act before the crocuses start to bloom in the spring  even if any replacement of the law could take years. Budget language released on Tuesday gives House and Senate committees only until Jan. 27 to produce legislation that would eliminate major parts of the health care law. Under arcane budget procedures  that legislation would be protected from a Democratic filibuster and could pass the Senate with a simple majority. And debate will begin on Wednesday  before senators have even moved into their new offices. The dueling over the health law’s fate will pull in both the departing and incoming White House administrations as well. On Wednesday  Mr. Obama will visit with congressional Democrats to plot how to resist the planned repeal  and Mike Pence  the vice   will meet with Republicans to gird them for the fight ahead. While the Senate action showed Republicans on course to keep campaign promises  the House got off to a messy start  brought on by Republicans who had moved largely in secret on Monday to gut a congressional ethics office against Mr. Ryan’s wishes. That provoked an outcry from both Democrats and voters who flooded House offices with angry calls. “Every   organization is calling my office ” said Representative Pete Sessions  Republican of Texas. “And we’ve told them: ‘Thank you very much. We appreciate your feedback. ’” After a hastily called meeting on Tuesday morning among Republicans  the matter was dropped before it could go to the full House floor for a vote. As the Senate moved to larger legislative matters  the House kerfuffle seemed to cast a shadow over Mr. Ryan  but he tried to brush it off. “There’s no sense of foreboding in the House today ” Mr. Ryan said after his   “only the sense of potential. ” The fight over the House rules was already acrimonious thanks to a piece of the package that would impose $2  500 in fines for filming events on the House floor  a response to Democrats who streamed their overnight   over guns last June using cellphones and video cameras. In the Senate  Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. swore in seven new members and all the incumbents who won their races last year  their colleagues looking on cheerfully  as a cold rain pelted the newly refurbished Capitol dome. Members of the House and Senate brought along their families  —   elderly parents with canes  small children tugging at uncomfortable lacy hems  —   as well as former senators and other special guests. Former Vice President Dick Cheney accompanied his daughter Liz to her   as a member of the House elected from Wyoming. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York officially became the Democratic leader and quickly warned Republicans that the minority would be vocal  if not operatic  in resisting much of their agenda and many of Mr. Trump’s nominees. “It is our job to do what’s best for the American people  the middle class and those struggling to get there ” he said. “If the   proposes legislation on issues like infrastructure  trade and closing the carried interest loophole  for instance  we will work in good faith to perfect and  potentially  enact it. When he doesn’t  we will resist. ” He added  “If   Trump lets the   members of Congress and his cabinet run the show  if he adopts their timeworn policies  —   which benefit the elites  the special interests and corporate America  not the working man and woman  —   his presidency will not succeed. ” On Tuesday  the House also adopted rules clearing the way for legislation to roll back the health care law. The budget blueprint introduced on Tuesday in the Senate is not sent to the president and does not become law  but still clears the way for subsequent legislation that Republicans say will repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Republicans bypassed the Budget Committee so they could immediately bring the measure to the floor. Such resolutions are normally developed after weeks of work in the Budget Committee. Under the plan  four congressional committees  —   two in the House and two in the Senate  —   have until Jan. 27 to develop legislation that will be the vehicle for repealing the health care law. The document does not specify which provisions of the law may be eliminated and which ones may be preserved. Nor does it specify or even suggest how Republicans would replace the Affordable Care Act  which the Obama administration says has provided coverage to some 20 million people who were previously uninsured. Republicans have said they may delay the effective date of a repeal bill  to avoid disrupting coverage for people who have it and to provide time for Republicans to develop alternatives to the 2010 health law. The budget blueprint allows Republicans to use savings from repealing major provisions of that law to help offset the cost of future  unspecified measures to help people obtain coverage. “Americans face skyrocketing premiums and soaring deductibles ” said Senator Mike Enzi  Republican of Wyoming and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. “Insurers are withdrawing from markets across the country  leaving many families with fewer choices and less access to care than they had before  —   the opposite of what the law promised. ” The American Medical Association urged Congress on Tuesday to explain how it would replace the Affordable Care Act. “Before any action is taken through reconciliation or other means that would potentially alter coverage  policy makers should lay out for the American people  in reasonable detail  what will replace current policies ” the chief executive of the association  Dr. James L. Madara  said in a letter to congressional leaders. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California  who engineered the House passage of the health law in 2010  promised this week that Democrats would be just as aggressive in fighting its repeal. Republicans have said they may delay legislation to replace the health law for several years. Ms. Pelosi said that such a delay would be “an act of cowardice on the part of Republicans ” and that “they don’t even have the votes to do it” because they have not agreed on a replacement plan. Democrats also vowed to give Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees rigorous scrutiny. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California  the   Democrat on the Judiciary Committee  has written to Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa  the committee chairman  asking to postpone the first scheduled confirmation hearing  set for next week for Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama 1.0 "WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump on Tuesday named as his chief trade negotiator a Washington lawyer who has long advocated protectionist policies  the latest sign that Mr. Trump intends to fulfill his campaign promise to get tough with China  Mexico and other trading partners. Mr. Trump also renewed his episodic campaign to persuade American companies to expand domestic manufacturing  criticizing General Motors via Twitter on Tuesday morning for making in Mexico some of the Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks it sells domestically. Hours later  Mr. Trump claimed credit after Ford said it would expand vehicle production in Flat Rock  Mich. The choice of Robert Lighthizer (pronounced   ) to be the United States’ trade representative nearly completes Mr. Trump’s selection of top economic advisers and  taken together with the  ’s running commentary on Twitter  underscores Mr. Trump’s focus on making things in America. That is causing unease among some Republicans who regard Mr. Trump’s views on trade as dangerously retrograde  even as they embrace the bulk of his economic agenda. Mainstream economists warn that protectionist policies like import taxes could impose higher prices on consumers and slow economic growth. But some Democrats are signaling a readiness to support Mr. Trump. Nine House Democrats held a news conference Tuesday with the A. F. L. . I. O. president  Richard Trumka  to urge renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. “We wanted him to know that we’ll work with him on doing that ” Mr. Trumka said. “I don’t think he has enough Republican support to do it  and rewriting the rules of trade is a necessary first step in righting the economy for working people. ” Mr. Trump and his top advisers on trade  including Mr. Lighthizer  share a view that the United States in recent decades prioritized the ideal of free trade over its own  . They argue that other countries are undermining America’s industrial base by subsidizing their own export industries while impeding American importers. They regard this unfair competition as a key reason for the lackluster growth of the economy. In picking Mr. Lighthizer  who has spent much of the last few decades representing American steel producers in their frequent litigation of trade disputes  Mr. Trump is seeking to hire one of Washington’s top trade lawyers to enforce international trade agreements more vigorously. He must be confirmed by the Senate. “He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity ” Mr. Trump said in a statement. Mainstream Republicans have sought common ground with Mr. Trump  emphasizing  for example  the importance of enforcing trade rules  but they have not abandoned the party’s longtime advocacy for trade. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah  the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee  which will hold hearings on Mr. Lighthizer’s nomination  issued a cautiously supportive statement Tuesday. “As the world and our economic competitors move to expand their global footprints  we can’t afford to be left behind in securing strong deals that will increase our access to new markets for   products and services ” Mr. Hatch said in a statement. “I look forward to a vigorous discussion of Bob’s trade philosophy and priorities. ” Mr. Trump has named a number of advisers on trade  leaving some ambiguity about the division of responsibilities. The   named the economist Peter Navarro  an outspoken critic of China  to lead a new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy. Mr. Trump also said Wilbur Ross  the billionaire investor and choice for commerce secretary  will play a key role. Mr. Lighthizer  however  is the only member of the triumvirate with government experience. “Those who say U. S. T. R. will be subordinated to other agencies are mistaken ” said Alan Wolff  another former senior American trade official who was the steel industry’s   on trade with Mr. Lighthizer for nearly 20 years  citing Mr. Lighthizer’s encyclopedic knowledge of trade law. “He’ll be a dominant figure on trade  in harmony with Wilbur Ross and Navarro. ” There is also an ideological divide between the people Mr. Trump has named to oversee trade policy and his broader circle of advisers  which is populated by longstanding trade advocates like Gary D. Cohn  the president of Goldman Sachs  who will lead the National Economic Council Rex W. Tillerson  the chief executive of Exxon Mobil  tapped for secretary of state and Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa  Mr. Trump’s choice for ambassador to China. Proponents of trade hope the broader circle  and congressional Republicans  will exert a moderating influence. “You’re seeing a pretty clear indication that there will be a focus on the enforcement of our trade agreements and on the letter of the law ” said Scott Lincicome  an international trade lawyer at White  Case. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean a significant turn toward protectionism. Even free trade guys like me support enforcement. ” Trade opponents on the left and the right  meanwhile  are hoping Mr. Trump means to break with several decades of   policy. “There’s going to be a war within the Trump administration on where they go with trade  and we’re hoping to energize the worker base he had to make sure they go in the right direction to benefit the American worker ” Mr. Trumka said. Mr. Trump’s promise to immediately designate China as a currency manipulator may offer an early test of the administration’s intentions. Economists see no evidence China is suppressing the value of its currency  although it has done so in the past. Mr. Lincicome said officially labeling China a currency manipulator despite the lack of recent evidence would signal that the administration is taking a hard line on trade issues. A broader shift in trade policy would unfold more slowly. Mr. Trump has promised to renegotiate Nafta the original process took most of three years. He has promised to pursue enforcement actions against other nations  but it takes time to mount cases. He has threatened to impose new tariffs on imports  but sweeping changes most likely would require congressional legislation. Mr. Trump already is seeking to exert influence by seizing the presidential bullhorn. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U. S. car   free across border ” he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Make in U. S. A. or pay big border tax!” General Motors announced in 2015 that it would make the Cruze in Coahuila  Mexico. American manufacturers are moving   production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs and because of declining domestic demand. They continue to build more expensive vehicles in the United States. Ford’s announcement Tuesday does not reverse that trend. The carmaker said it still planned to move production of the compact Ford Focus from Michigan to Mexico. But it said it would invest in a different Michigan plant to expand production of   vehicles  including its   pickup truck and the Mustang sports car  as well as a new   sport utility vehicle. “We are encouraged by the   policies that   Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue ” said the company’s chief executive  Mark Fields. Mr. Lighthizer served as deputy United States trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration  when he was involved in pressing Japan to reduce its restrictions on American imports and its subsidies for its own exports. Mr. Trump has criticized China for similar practices  setting the stage for a new round of confrontations. Reagan is often remembered as an advocate for free trade  but his administration in its early hours imposed a quota on Japanese auto imports. It was the first in a long series of measures aimed at putting pressure on the nation that was then regarded  like China in recent years  as a threat to American prosperity. “President Reagan’s pragmatism contrasted strongly with the utopian dreams of free traders ” Mr. Lighthizer wrote in a 2008 piece criticizing Senator John McCain  Republican of Arizona  for embracing “unbridled” free trade. Conservatives  he argued 1.0 "■   Donald J. Trump appears to side with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over United States intelligence agencies  with Vice   Mike Pence backing him up. ■ She’s hired: Omarosa Manigault gets a White House post  as do some notable Trump loyalists. But Mr. Trump is leaning on Republican veterans in the Oval Office’s top slots. ■ The   finds something “very strange” about his intelligence briefing on Friday  —   even though the White House says it was always planned for Friday. For the Republican Party  Mr. Assange  the WikiLeaks founder  was once purely a villain. He found little sympathy with conservatives after he leaked American military secrets from Iraq  published purloined diplomatic cables that could have gotten American sources killed and sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London  fleeing charges of rape. But now  Mr. Trump appears to be siding with Mr. Assange over the conclusions of America’s intelligence services. Mr. Assange appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night with Sean Hannity  one of Mr. Trump’s biggest news media boosters  to declare once again that the Russians were not the source of the purloined emails that WikiLeaks released from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman  John Podesta. Mr. Trump followed that appearance with a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released  most likely by Thursday. There were actually two separate hackings that the Obama administration has said came from Russian intelligence  —   with “100 percent” certainty. As he has previously  Mr. Assange said: “Our source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties. ” But Mr. Assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources. It is highly unlikely that anyone approaching WikiLeaks with the emails obtained by Russian government hacking would acknowledge the source  so it is likely that Mr. Assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails. Mr. Assange and Mr. Hannity did not address that  in addition to WikiLeaks  the leaked Democratic material was published by two mysterious websites  DCLeaks. com and a blog written by someone called Guccifer 2. 0. American intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by Russian agents. In addition to American intelligence agencies  most private researchers also say they believe that the D. N. C. and Podesta hackings were carried out on orders of Russian government officials  though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public. Mr. Assange’s statement is unlikely to change that conclusion. Intelligence officials will brief Congress on their Russia inquiry on Thursday  ahead of a briefing for Mr. Trump in New York on Friday. Senator John McCain of Arizona  chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  will hold the first hearing on the matter on Thursday as well. As for that “terrible” information mentioned by Mr. Trump  the CNN commentator Donna Brazile did send Mr. Podesta an email ahead of a Democratic presidential debate in Flint  Mich. tipping him off that a woman in the audience would ask why the government was not doing more to help clean the city’s   water supply. That was  in fact  reported widely and often  here and here and here and here  among other places. And that was hardly an unexpected query  —   for Mrs. Clinton or for her rival  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It did cause Ms. Brazile to lose her CNN post. The   appears to be getting a jump on the news. Vice   Mike Pence defended Mr. Trump’s Assange posts at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday  effectively doubling down on the incoming administration’s icy blasts toward United States intelligence. Mr. Trump “expressed his very sincere and healthy American skepticism about intelligence conclusions ” Mr. Pence said  with House Republican leaders by his side. Mr. Trump’s remarks have again placed fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position. Asked on Wednesday morning about the Twitter post  Speaker Paul D. Ryan steered clear of criticizing the   saying he would not be commenting on “every little tweet or Facebook post. ” But he called Mr. Assange “a sycophant for Russia ” who “leaks  steals data and compromises national security. ” Mr. Ryan noted that Mr. Trump had not yet received his latest briefing on Russia. “Hopefully  he’ll get up to speed on what’s been happening and what Russia has or has not done ” he said. Ms. Manigault  the villain and diva from Mr. Trump’s reality television show “The Apprentice ” was officially named assistant to the president and director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison  one of a slate of Wednesday appointments that went to ardent Trump loyalists. The appointments include Bill Stepien  a confidant of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and a figure in the “Bridgegate” scandal  who will be White House political director. Keith Schiller  who was head of private security at Mr. Trump’s real estate company  will be director of Oval Office operations. John DeStefano  a longtime aide to former House Speaker John A. Boehner  will direct presidential personnel. And George Gigicos  who organized those giant campaign rallies  will be director of advance  a further indicator that Mr. Trump plans to continue that sort of thing as president. But for star power  no one is going to beat Ms. Manigault. Ms. Manigault aside  Mr. Trump is turning to some seasoned veterans to run key operations in his White House. Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday that he had selected Joe Hagin  who served for 14 years in the White House under Roanld Reagan  George Bush and George W. Bush  as his deputy chief of staff for operations  a key post in which he will be responsible for organizing presidential trips and security  among other things. He named Rick Dearborn  who has 25 years of experience on Capitol Hill  as his chief liaison to Congress  heading the Office of Legislative Affairs as well as the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Cabinet Affairs. Katie Walsh  who was chief of staff at the Republican National Committee under Reince Priebus  Mr. Trump’s incoming chief of staff  will become his deputy at the White House  overseeing senior staff  scheduling and the Office of Public Liaison. In a statement  Mr. Priebus called the three a “team of doers” who would fill critical roles. Kellyanne Conway  who served as counselor to Mr. Trump  said she was thrilled to have “another strong female leader” on the team in Ms. Walsh. First  Mr. Trump said that the nation should move beyond talk of Russian interference in the presidential election  but that he would listen to what American intelligence experts had to say. Then  on New Year’s Eve  the   promised that by Tuesday or Wednesday  he would reveal information on the hacking that Americans do not know. And now  he seems to think the intelligence community has not quite gotten its story straight. The Obama administration quickly let it be known that  in fact  intelligence leaders always intended to brief Mr. Trump on Friday in New York. And intelligence officials were not amused. Nor were some Republican political consultants. But this is not the first time the   has taken a swipe at the intelligence community  which has concluded that Russia tried to help get him elected president. President Obama is on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to plot a strategy to save his signature domestic achievement  the Affordable Care Act. Vice   Mike Pence countered with his own visit to congressional Republicans. “The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare ” Mr. Pence said. “It needs to be done. ” And Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter  trying to stiffen Republican spines as Democrats press their point that a fast gutting of the law will endanger the health care of 20 million people covered under the law and put at risk tens of millions more with   health problems. “Schumer clowns” may not be an olive branch to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the new minority leader  but it is a signal that the incoming president is ready for war over health care. “Republicans should stop clowning around with Americans’ Medicare  Medicaid and health care ” Mr. Schumer responded after meeting with the president. He warned that Republicans would “throw the entire health care system into chaos. ” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California  the House minority leader  tried to coin a phrase: “Make America sick again? Is that what Republicans want?” The Trump transition office named the lawyer Jay Clayton to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The last time Mr. Trump held a real news conference was on July 27  when he said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had called him a genius and wrongly insisted that “many people” saw bombs strewn all over the floor of the San Bernardino  Calif. attackers’ home and failed to report it. That long stretch without a real news media grilling did not do him much harm. He did  after all  win the election. But he says he will hold a true  open news conference next Wednesday. No word yet whether this session will take the place of the one he scheduled for last month  then canceled "LOS ANGELES  —   Girding for four years of potential battles with   Donald J. Trump  Democratic leaders of the California Legislature announced Wednesday that they had hired Eric H. Holder Jr. who was attorney general under President Obama  to represent them in any legal fights against the new Republican White House. The decision by the Legislature to retain Mr. Holder  who is now a prominent Washington lawyer  is the latest sign of  the ideological battle that may play out over the next four years between this predominantly Democratic state and Washington. Hillary Clinton  the Democratic candidate for president  defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes here. “Having the former attorney general of the United States brings us a lot of firepower in order to prepare to safeguard the values of the people of California ” Kevin de León  the Democratic leader of the Senate  said in an interview. “This means we are very  very serious. ” Mr. de León said he expected California to challenge Washington  —   and defend itself from policies instituted in Washington  —   on issues including the environment  immigration and criminal justice. He said California Democrats decided to turn to Mr. Holder as they watched Mr. Trump assemble his cabinet and begin to set the tone for his presidency. “It was very clear that it wasn’t just campaign rhetoric ” Mr. de León said of Mr. Trump’s proposals over the past year. “He was surrounding himself with people who are a very clear and present danger to the economic prosperity of California. ” Mr. Trump did not immediately return requests for comment. The move by Mr. de León and his Democratic counterpart in the Assembly  Anthony Rendon  follows Gov. Jerry Brown’s appointment of Representative Xavier Becerra as attorney general last month  to succeed Kamala D. Harris  who was elected to the United States Senate. That appointment made Mr. Becerra one of the   Latino officials in this state  and he is expected to be instrumental in battling with the Trump White House over any attempt to enforce stringent measures aimed at immigrants. Mr. Brown has made clear that he intends to challenge the administration on global warming and that his attorney general will be a key to that battle. The Democratic Party controls   of both the Assembly and the Senate in California. Every statewide elected official is a Democrat. Mr. Holder was Mr. Obama’s attorney general from 2009 to 2015. He was the first   to hold that position. He is a partner at Covington  Burling  a law firm in Washington that specializes in representing states and companies against the federal government. “I am honored that the Legislature chose Covington to serve as its legal adviser as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California’s residents and policy priorities ” Mr. Holder said in a statement. “I am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the Legislature. ” The Legislature has an ample stable of lawyers on staff  but officials said Mr. Holder and his firm brought specific litigation and political skills that could be needed in the coming years. Mr. de León said the final compensation for the firm had not been set  but would be publicly disclosed once it was. “The cost will be very minimal compared to the billions of dollars at stake if California doesn’t adequately make its case "JERUSALEM  —   The fate of just one   Israeli soldier was hanging in the balance. But for many Israelis  the guilty verdict announced on Wednesday was a critical turn in the battle for the character of the state. When the military judges convicted Sgt. Elor Azaria of manslaughter for shooting a Palestinian assailant in the head as he lay wounded on the ground  they were ruling not just on his conduct but also on the host of ethical and political issues it raised. Since the shooting in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March  the case has polarized Israelis and rocked the pedestal on which the military normally stands. With the 50th anniversary of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank approaching  the highly charged trial had fueled a debate about military ethics and the place of the army in Israeli society. The verdict did little to heal the rifts the trial had exposed: Hours after it was rendered  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined a chorus of voices calling for the soldier to be pardoned. “This is a difficult and painful day for us all ” Mr. Netanyahu said in a Facebook post supporting a pardon  which can be granted by Israel’s president or the army’s top officials. Referring to the Israel Defense Forces  he added  “The soldiers of the I. D. F. are our sons and daughters  and they need to remain above any dispute. ” Prof. David Enoch  an expert in the philosophy of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  said he thought the manslaughter conviction was “justified” but added  “I’m not sure this verdict will be welcomed by many of the soldiers and much of the public. ” The military’s rules make clear that assailants must be quickly incapacitated  but that once the threat is neutralized  they should not be killed. Rights groups and other critics have accused Israeli soldiers and police officers of being too quick to pull the trigger  particularly in response to a recent spate of deadly stabbings  shootings and car attacks by Palestinians. The Hebron killing  caught in chilling completeness in a video that quickly went viral worldwide  for many critics crystallized the question of excessive force  and even military leaders said Sergeant Azaria acted without justification. But in Israel  a country where military service is a part of national identity  many Jews called for backing up young soldiers sent on dangerous missions and said that Sergeant Azaria had been in an impossible situation and had little chance of an acquittal  since that would have put his commanders in a bad light. Israel’s defense minister  Avigdor Lieberman  called Wednesday’s decision “a tough verdict. ” “The first thing I ask of all of us  —   those who like the verdict and those like me who like it much less  —   we are all obligated to respect the court’s decision ” Mr. Lieberman said. “We are obligated to maintain restraint. ” Mr. Lieberman  as a member of the parliamentary opposition before his cabinet appointment  had attended the military court to support Sergeant Azaria and called the legal proceedings a “theater of the absurd. ” But on Wednesday  he said  “We must keep the army above and beyond all political argument. ” Politicians to Mr. Netanyahu’s right and left have also called for a pardon  including the education minister  Naftali Bennett  and Shelly Yacimovich of the Labor Party  who said that “Azaria’s shoulders are too narrow to bear the entire weight of the fissure” the case has exposed. Some Israeli experts compared the Azaria verdict to the Kafr Qassem ruling of more than 60 years ago  after border police officers fatally shot 49 Arab men  women and children as they returned from work in the fields  unwittingly breaking a curfew. The murder convictions of officers in that case established that security forces must refuse to follow a “patently illegal order” that carries a “black flag” of criminality. It helped shape the army’s ethos. Now  some fear that in the lower ranks  it has begun to erode. In a measure of the tensions  the verdict was handed down in a special court inside the walled and heavily guarded compound of the military’s headquarters in Tel Aviv  rather than in the courtroom where the trial was held  to keep demonstrators at bay. Video footage showed Sergeant Azaria smiling as he entered the courtroom to applause  and he was embraced by his family and friends. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound  shouting slogans like “free the boy. ” Col. Maya Heller  one of the military judges  spent more than two and a half hours delivering the verdict. She systematically rejected the main points of the defense and said there had been “no justification” for the shooting  according to reports from the courtroom. Describing Sergeant Azaria’s telling of the event as “twisting” and “evolving ” the judge said the defense had tried to “hold the rope at both ends. ” On one hand it asserted that the victim  Abed     appeared to pose a danger because he was still moving  and on the other it brought medical witnesses who contended that he was dead by the time Sergeant Azaria shot him in the head. The judge seemed to give great weight to statements Sergeant Azaria  a medic who was 19 at the time  made at the scene  indicating he had acted not out of fear but for revenge. A soldier testified that before the shooting  Sergeant Azaria had said  “How is it that my friend was stabbed and the terrorist is still alive?” After the shooting  a commander who was at the scene recalled Sergeant Azaria saying  “The terrorist deserved to die. ” Ilan Katz  one of Sergeant Azaria’s lawyers  vowed to appeal. The military’s high command had denounced the shooting immediately after it happened  calling it a grave breach of proper military conduct. But Israeli society was divided against the backdrop of continued Palestinian attacks  many   politicians and celebrities  along with Jewish parents of soldiers  hailed Sergeant Azaria as a hero. Mr. Netanyahu first condemned Sergeant Azaria’s actions  then phoned the soldier’s family to offer sympathy and reassurances that he would be treated fairly. Local television stations frequently showed images of Sergeant Azaria’s distraught parents hugging him in court. Appealing to public sentiment in a country blighted by wars and terrorism  and where most Jewish    are conscripted for up to 32 months of military service  his supporters portrayed him as “everybody’s child. ” In remarks recorded before the verdict  the military’s chief of staff  Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot  tried to puncture that narrative. “An    in the Israeli Army is not ‘everybody’s child ’” he said. “He is a fighter  a soldier who must dedicate his life to carry out the tasks we give him. We cannot be confused about this. ” The episode began when two Palestinian men stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint in Hebron. Israeli soldiers killed one and wounded the other  Mr. Sharif  21. Sergeant Azaria arrived at the scene about six minutes later. The video showed calm had been restored. Yet 11 minutes after the initial attack  he cocked his rifle and shot Mr. Sharif as he lay on the road. Lawyers representing Sergeant Azaria said he had acted to save his comrades  in the belief that Mr. Sharif  who was still moving  might have been concealing an explosive belt under his jacket. But Sergeant Azaria did not warn the other soldiers or the medical staff nearby to move away. During the trial  Sergeant Azaria’s company commander  Maj. Tom Naaman  said he “did not feel any danger” from Mr. Sharif  undercutting the defendant’s claims. Yusri   Mr. Sharif’s father  told reporters that the verdict was “a good step” but that he hoped there would be no lenience in the sentencing  which is scheduled for Jan. 15. Ahmad Tibi  an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament  said on  Twitter that dozens of soldiers and commanders who killed Palestinians should have been convicted. “Fifty years of occupation add up to much more than one Azaria "Stuck at your work desk? Standing up and walking around for five minutes every hour during the workday could lift your mood  combat lethargy without reducing focus and attention  and even dull hunger pangs  according to an instructive new study. The study  which also found that frequent  brief walking breaks were more effective at improving   than a single  longer walk before work  could provide the basis for a simple  realistic New Year’s exercise resolution for those of us bound to our desks all day. There is growing evidence  of course  that long bouts of uninterrupted sitting can have undesirable physical and emotional consequences. Studies have shown that sitting motionless reduces blood flow to the legs  increasing the risk for atherosclerosis  the buildup of plaques in the arteries. People who sit for more than eight or nine hours daily  which for many of us describes a typical workday  also are at heightened risk for diabetes  depression and obesity compared with people who move more often. In response  researchers and some bosses have proposed a variety of methods for helping people reduce their sitting time at work  including standing workstations and treadmill desks. But such options are cumbersome and costly  making them impractical for many work situations. Some experts have worried  too  that if people are physically active at the office  they might subsequently become more tired  grumpy  distracted or hungry  any of which could have an undesirable effect on work performance and   health. So for the new study  which was published in November in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus  the Johnson  Johnson Human Performance Institute and other institutions decided to test several methods of increasing movement among office workers. (The study was funded largely by Johnson  Johnson  with additional support from the Colorado Nutrition Obesity Research Center.) To start  the researchers invited 30 sedentary adult office workers to a university clinic to complete a battery of health tests and questionnaires. The researchers measured their heart rates and stress hormone levels and asked them to rank  on a numerical scale  how energetic or tired they felt  as well as how happy they were  and whether they were feeling peckish or had little appetite just then. The volunteers also completed computerized games designed primarily to test their ability to concentrate and make decisions. Then  on three subsequent visits to the clinic  each volunteer simulated a   workday. During one visit  the volunteers sat for the whole time with no interruptions  except for bathroom breaks. During another  they walked moderately for 30 minutes at the start of their experimental day  and then sat for the next five and a half hours with no additional scheduled breaks. Finally  during a third visit  the volunteers sat for most of the six hours  but began each hour with five minutes of moderate walking  using treadmills at the clinic. At the start and end of each session  the researchers drew blood to check levels of stress hormones. And periodically throughout each day  they asked their volunteers to numerically rate their moods  energy  fatigue and appetites. The volunteers also repeated the computerized testing of their thinking skills at the close of each session. The researchers then analyzed the data. The numbers showed that on almost all measures  the subjects’ ratings of how they were feeling rose when they did not sit for six uninterrupted hours. They said that they felt much more energetic throughout the day if they had been active  whether that activity was bunched into a single longish walk at the start of the day or distributed into multiple brief breaks. On other measures  though  the   walks were more potent than the concentrated   version. When the workers rose most often  they reported greater happiness  less fatigue and considerably less craving for food than on either of the other days. Their feelings of vigor also tended to increase throughout the day  while they often had plateaued by early afternoon after walking only once in the morning. There were no differences on the scores on the cognitive tests  whether they sat all day or got up and moved. Stress hormones also remained steady during each visit. These results suggest that “even a little bit of activity  spread throughout the day  is a practical  easy way to improve ” says Jack Groppel  a study author and a founder of the Johnson  Johnson Human Performance Institute. He points out that the walking breaks did not cause people to feel more tired or hungry  but instead had the opposite effect. They also did not alter people’s ability to focus  so  in theory  should not affect productivity (for good or ill). This study  however  was small in scale    and limited by its dependence on the volunteers’ perceptions of their responses to the experiment. But even so  “it’s clear that moving matters ” Dr. Groppel says. So set your 2017 appointment calendar  he suggests  to devote five minutes every hour to physical activity  whether you walk up and down a staircase "It’s that time of year when financial advice sites issue their lists of the “Stocks to Buy for 2017. ” Before you take them up on their suggestions  let’s look at how well such portfolios did in 2016. The portfolios of stocks they were telling you to buy generally did much worse than the stock market over all. The results underline what many personal finance experts recommend: Invest in a broad    mutual index fund. (The Times’s “Your Money” columnist wrote more on this here.) In 2016  the broad S. P. stock index increased 9. 5 percent. But if you invested in Forbes’s 2016 list  your money grew about 7 percent. Kiplinger’s was about half that. A list that appeared on the Money magazine site garnered 4. 9 percent  and Barron’s returned 5. 3 percent. One such list at CNBC did a little better than most at 10. 6 percent. But Vanguard’s Total Stock index fund returned 12. 5 percent in the same period. We even calculated these returns by assuming that any of the dividends were reinvested  but still none beat the widely owned index fund. There is nothing wrong with these lists if you are using them as mere suggestions of what companies might be worth investigating. There were some bona fide winners on almost every list: Goldman Sachs  Kennametal  Ellie Mae  Douglas Dynamics    Burlington Stores. You might not have heard of some of those companies  so it’s not a bad place to look for ideas. But the problem with such lists is that they encourage people to approach investing the wrong way. Unsophisticated investors are being persuaded that they should own a sheaf of stocks. But as you can see  even when the stocks are recommended by professional money managers and filtered through some of the best financial journalists  they don’t do as well as the averages. The best advice remains the same: If you have money you want to play with  go have some fun with a few stocks that you can monitor closely. If you keep it simple  it’s easier to track and respond. But for the rest of us  the smart investment is  those index funds. They cost less than stocks or other funds. They remove most of the emotion from your decision making
