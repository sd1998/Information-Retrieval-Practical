"WASHINGTON  —   Republicans hope to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act using an expedited procedure known as budget reconciliation. The process is sometimes called arcane  but it has been used often in the past 35 years to write some of the nation’s most important laws. “Reconciliation is probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to Congress for a large portion of the budget ” the Congressional Research Service  a nonpartisan arm of Congress  has said. Here is a primer. Q. What is the budget reconciliation process? A. It is a way for Congress to speed action on legislation that changes taxes or spending  especially spending for entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Although conceived primarily as a way to reduce federal budget deficits  it has also been used to cut taxes and to create programs that increase spending  —   changes that can raise deficits. In the Senate  a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority. For other bills  a   majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote. Q. Why is it called reconciliation? A. The term originated in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974  which was intended to give Congress more control over the budget process by allowing lawmakers to set overall levels of spending and revenue. The process begins with a budget blueprint  a resolution that guides Congress but is not presented to the president for a signature or veto. It recommends federal revenue  deficit  debt and spending levels in areas like defense  energy  education and health care. The resolution may direct one or more committees to develop legislation to achieve specified budgetary results. By adopting these proposals  Congress can change existing laws so that actual revenue and spending are brought into line with  —   reconciled with  —   policies in the budget resolution. Q. How has reconciliation been used? A. Since 1980  Congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills. Twenty became law. Four were vetoed. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the “Reagan revolution. ” It squeezed savings out of Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  food stamps  the school lunch program  farm subsidies  student loans  welfare and jobless benefits  among many other programs. In 1996  Congress reversed six decades of social welfare policy  eliminating the individual entitlement to cash assistance for the nation’s poorest children and giving each state a lump sum of federal money with vast discretion over its use. Those changes were made in a reconciliation bill  pushed by Republicans but signed by President Bill Clinton. Congress reduced deficits with another reconciliation bill  the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That law also created the Children’s Health Insurance Program  primarily for uninsured children in   families. On the same day in 1997  Mr. Clinton signed a separate reconciliation bill that cut taxes. The Bush tax cuts were adopted in reconciliation bills signed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003. On several occasions  Congress has increased assistance to   working families by increasing the   tax credit in reconciliation bills. Congress also made changes to the Affordable Care Act in a reconciliation bill passed immediately after President Obama signed the health care overhaul in 2010. Later  when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress  they passed a reconciliation bill to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act  but Mr. Obama vetoed the bill in January 2016. Republicans say that measure will provide a template or starting point for their efforts to undo the health care law this year  with support from   Donald J. Trump  who calls the law “an absolute disaster. ” Q. How does the reconciliation process work in the Senate? A. In the House  leaders of the majority party can usually control what happens if their members stick together. In the Senate  by contrast  one member or a handful of senators can often derail the leaders’ plans. The reconciliation process enhances the power of the majority party and its leaders. Senate debate on a reconciliation bill is normally limited to 20 hours  so it cannot be filibustered on the Senate floor. The Senate has a special rule to prevent abuse of the budget reconciliation process. The rule  named for former Senator Robert C. Byrd  Democrat of West Virginia  generally bars use of the procedure to consider legislation that has no effect on spending  taxes and deficits. The Senate parliamentarian normally decides whether particular provisions violate the Byrd rule  but the Senate can waive the rule with a   majority. Q. What does this mean for the Affordable Care Act? A. Republicans hope to use the   procedure of budget reconciliation to repeal or nullify provisions of the law that affect spending and taxes. They could  for example  eliminate penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees. They could use a reconciliation bill to eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid. And they could use it to repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges. Republicans could also repeal a number of taxes and fees imposed on certain   people and on health insurers and manufacturers of   prescription drugs and medical devices: tax increases that help offset the cost of the insurance coverage expansions. Those provisions were all rolled back in the reconciliation bill Mr. Obama vetoed last January. That bill did not touch insurance market standards established in the Affordable Care Act  which do not directly cost the government money or raise taxes. The standards stipulate  for example  that insurers cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a person’s   conditions. Insurers must allow parents to keep children on their policies until the age of 26  and they cannot charge women higher rates than men  as they often did in the past. Such provisions are politically popular  but it is not clear how they could remain in force without the coverage expansions that help insurers afford such regulations. Without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance  and without subsidies  supporters of the health law say many healthy people would go without coverage  knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it. Democrats say they will fight to preserve the law after Mr. Obama leaves office. Recent history shows that lobbying and public pressure can sometimes make a difference 1.0 "WASHINGTON  —   Majorities in Congress often overreach  but usually not on the very first day. House Republicans  on the verge of a Washington takeover as the new Congress convened Tuesday  couldn’t stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business. In the process  they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an   celebration of unified Republican government  undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come. House Republicans take a stand on a contentious issue  Donald J. Trump turns to Twitter to break with House Republicans  then Republicans frantically reverse course. “Mr. Trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp  and here we are on Day 1 trying to fill the swamp ” Representative Walter B. Jones  Republican of North Carolina  said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers. “That is not a good way to start. ” Deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines  chagrined Republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted Monday night in a   party meeting before Mr. Trump weighed in via Twitter and suggested that the overhaul shouldn’t be a top priority  urging Republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care. But the final decision did come after the  ’s Twitter posts  underscoring his sway over House Republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the majority leader. House Republicans might have amusedly applauded Mr. Trump’s cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes  but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way  raising alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. Following the decision to reverse course  several lawmakers were quietly fretting that Mr. Trump’s megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized. Other Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill were wondering how the   proposal got as far as it did  given the stated reservations of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy among others. They said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter  demonstrating once again how hard it can be to manage the House Republicans even when the party is set to control both Capitol Hill and the White House. Mr. Ryan had already headed off an earlier rules change that was deemed potentially embarrassing: a proposal to let lawmakers resume funding of pet projects through designated “earmarks” as long as the money went to public entities. Abuse of earmarks was one of the main sources of congressional corruption that led to tighter ethics rules and a ban on such spending  and Mr. Ryan and his allies believed that a quick move to restore them so soon after Mr. Trump’s election would not send the proper signal. But Mr. Ryan has promised to revisit both the earmark issue and the revisions to the Office of Congressional Ethics later this year. The ethics office was created in 2008 at the urging of Representative Nancy Pelosi  the California Democrat who was then the House speaker. This was in response to criticism that the Select Committee on Ethics  comprising lawmakers from both parties  was ineffective  given a string of   corruption cases and other breakdowns such as a scandal involving teenage House pages. Lawmakers from both parties were against the office then  as well as now  and would much prefer to be judged by their peers  —   politicians currently serving in the House who might be more sympathetic  —   as opposed to a more discrete board and staff. But in moving ahead with the rules change on a strictly partisan basis  Republicans opened the door to Democrats berating them for the proposal  even though a significant number of Democrats are just as unhappy with the ethics office. It was similar to a move House Republicans made in 2005 when they used the   rules package to weaken the ethics committee itself after a series of rebukes against Tom DeLay  the majority leader. That decision sparked an outcry from Democrats and watchdog groups that helped Democrats regain the majority the next year with a message that Republicans were fostering a culture of corruption. “I think it is always better to do changes to the ethics process in a bipartisan manner ” said John Feehery  a former top Republican aide in the House. “It protects you from political attacks. ” The tussle over the ethics office is just one illustration of how Mr. Trump and his outsider ideas could clash with his own party in Congress. Mr. Trump has vowed to move forward with a proposal to impose term limits on Congress  and many in the party are not happy with that idea. Other sources of friction are bound to emerge  given his campaign message about shaking up Washington. “I just could not believe that the Congress does not understand that  if anything  we need to bring sunshine in "WASHINGTON  —   Ivanka Trump  who is weighing a prominent role in her father’s administration  is planning to move with her family to a mansion in the exclusive Kalorama section of Washington  two people familiar with the decision said Wednesday. The house was previously owned by a   financier with extensive investments in Russia and ties to a Russian opposition leader. Ms. Trump and her husband  Jared Kushner  a close adviser to   Donald J. Trump who is expected to be an influential voice in the administration  have chosen a      house just around the corner from President Obama’s new home. The newly renovated house  with its sleekly modern décor  sold for $5. 5 million in December  the people said  insisting on anonymity because the transaction was private. The home was previously owned by Dan K. Rapoport and his wife  Irina  according to property records filed with the District of Columbia. Neither responded to emailed requests for comment. Ms. Trump’s relocation plans  first reported by Washingtonian magazine  are the latest evidence that she and Mr. Kushner will remain major players in Mr. Trump’s administration. Both played crucial roles in his presidential bid and have wielded outsize power during his transition. People close to the couple declined to comment on their impending move  as did William F. X. Moody  a   at Washington Fine Properties  who first disclosed the deal. But in the neighborhood where they are planning to live  —     of ambassadors and prominent figures on the Washington social circuit  —   residents have been buzzing about their    neighbors. “Everybody’s atwitter about it ” said Tony Podesta  chairman of the Podesta Group  a top Washington lobbying firm. “I’ve been getting lots of emails saying  ‘Here we go again ’ ” Mr. Podesta said  alluding to the burst of local mayhem that attended the decision by Mr. Obama and his family to rent a   home in the neighborhood after they leave the White House. “It will be great to have them as neighbors ” Mr. Podesta said of Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner  who have three children. The white house on Tracy Place where Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner plan to live with their children is just around the corner from the Obamas’ luxurious   home on Belmont Road  which has been undergoing extensive renovations directed by the Secret Service to fortify it for their arrival. A security checkpoint is expected to be built at the intersection of Tracy and Belmont before Mr. Obama moves in  residents said. There was no sign of Ms. Trump or her husband at the house on Wednesday afternoon. But the property was a flurry of activity  as workers and painters filed in and out past television reporters staked out on the sidewalk and   speculated about their new neighbors. John Damgard  who has owned a house on the block since 1971  said his new neighbors could expect to be welcomed “with open arms ” even by the neighborhood’s Democrats. “It’s quiet  it’s private  and they’ll be graciously received ” Mr. Damgard said. The house was home for several decades to Renee Zlotnick Kraft  a Washington fur heiress and socialite  who frequently opened its doors for events and even occasionally rolled out a pink carpet to welcome the city’s dinner party set. According to the website of his investment firm  Rapoport Capital  Mr. Rapoport was born in Riga  Latvia  and has lived in the United States  France and Russia. Vladimir Ashurkov  a top aide to Aleksei A. Navalny  a leading Russian opposition leader and critic of the Russian president  Vladimir V. Putin  described Mr. Rapoport as a successful financier in Moscow and an investor in Soho Rooms  one of the city’s poshest nightclubs. He has also been a supporter of Mr. Navalny since 2010. He recently relocated from Washington to Kiev  Ukraine  where he manages a private equity fund  Mr. Ashurkov said. It was not clear whether Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner bought the house from the Rapoports or would be renting it from a new owner. But after scouting locations in other exclusive neighborhoods  including nearby Georgetown "The Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles  nor is he well known in corporate America. He is the insider’s insider  —   a deal maker. As such  his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. In contrast  the agency’s two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds. Mr. Clayton  known as Jay  has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms. His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities. He had a   seat to the financial crisis  advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings  including the biggest ever  the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013. If Mr. Clayton is confirmed  he may have to recuse himself from some matters. A similar scrutiny was applied to Mary Jo White  the agency’s current chairwoman. She had been a litigator at Debevoise  Plimpton  where her clients included JPMorgan Chase  Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation and Kenneth D. Lewis  a former Bank of America chief executive. Still  such recusals are not unusual. Laura S. Unger  a former commissioner and acting chairwoman  said that during her tenure  she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission. She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission’s ethics officer. “An ethics officer at the S. E. C. knows all of your intimate details  and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts ” she noted. Yet Mr. Clayton’s nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs could wield too much influence in the Trump administration. Sullivan  Cromwell  where Mr. Clayton is a partner  has been Goldman’s   law firm for more than a century. Mr. Clayton advised Goldman Sachs on perhaps its most important deal  the $5 billion investment by Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway amid the financial crisis. Mr. Clayton’s wife works as a   adviser at Goldman. The S. E. C. nomination follows the appointment of Goldman’s No. 2 executive  Gary D. Cohn  to be the top economic policy adviser to   Donald J. Trump  and the selection of a hedge fund manager who was a former Goldman trader  Steven T. Mnuchin  to be Treasury secretary. Mr. Trump’s chief strategist  Stephen K. Bannon  is a former Goldman banker. During the presidential campaign  Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized Goldman Sachs as an emblem of a financial elite. Mr. Trump  who met with Mr. Clayton on Dec. 22  said in a statement that the lawyer “will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time. ” Mr. Clayton is expected to face scrutiny on his confirmation as a Sullivan  Cromwell colleague  H. Rodgin Cohen  did in 2009. Mr. Cohen  the dean of Wall Street lawyers  withdrew his name from consideration for a senior Treasury role amid an outcry over his deep involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep   Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder ’” Senator Sherrod Brown  Democrat of Ohio  said. “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited  demand real accountability from financial institutions the S. E. C. oversees and work to prevent another financial crisis. ” One issue could be Mr. Clayton’s representation of Alibaba. The Chinese   giant is under investigation by the S. E. C. over its accounting practices. Mr. Clayton also represented   Capital Management in its $1. 2 billion initial public offering a decade ago  and subsequent offerings and financing. A unit of the New   hedge fund pleaded guilty for what federal prosecutors said were more than $100 million in bribes paid to officials in African countries. The hedge fund was forced to pay a $400 million settlement. Government authorities said in September that they were still investigating individuals related to case. Another issue could be a 2011 report critical of the government’s enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  which argued that “the current   regime” was “causing lasting harm to the competitiveness of U. S. regulated companies and the U. S. capital markets. ” Mr. Clayton was the chairman of the New York City bar association committee that drafted the report. Requests to speak with Mr. Clayton at Sullivan  Cromwell were not answered. A number of fellow deal lawyers said they were glad that the    practitioner could be at the helm of the S. E. C. “He’s a very smart  pragmatic guy who has real deal experience and has seen this stuff firsthand ” said Richard Truesdell  a head of Davis Polk’s global capital markets group  who has worked with Mr. Clayton on several deals. “There’s been a lot of buzz today  and I have yet to talk to anyone who isn’t pleasantly surprised by the choice. ” The role of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors and enable companies to raise capital through the public markets in a way that fosters economic growth. The latter is a key tenet of Mr. Trump’s economic plan  with the aim that companies can use the excess capital to create jobs. Harvey Pitt  a former chairman of the S. E. C. appointed by President George W. Bush  said Mr. Clayton was a “  appointment. ” “It is especially logical with respect to the agency’s obligation to promote capital formation  a subject with which the incoming administration is appropriately concerned ” said Mr. Pitt in an email. “Mr. Clayton’s background is very impressive  —   both for the depth of his experience  and for the quality of his efforts. ” Mr. Clayton went to the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cambridge for separate bachelor’s degrees and then obtained his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Mr. Clayton donated to Mitt Romney and Mr. Obama in previous presidential elections and to Jeb Bush’s primary campaign in 2015  according to public records. Those who know Mr. Clayton describe him as the     type  a doer who is often in the shadows of the better known Mr. Cohen at Sullivan  Cromwell. “When I think about the position  the guy has a really deep understanding of the capital markets and financial regulatory matters  so he checks those boxes ” said Brad Whitman  vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley 2017.0 1.0 "CHARLESTON  S. C.  —   Seeming to abdicate one of his last chances to save his own life  the convicted killer Dylann S. Roof stood on Wednesday before the jurors who will decide his fate and offered no apology  no explanation and no remorse for massacring nine black churchgoers during a Bible study session in June 2015. Instead  in a strikingly brief opening statement in the sentencing phase of his federal death penalty trial  Mr. Roof repeatedly assured the jury that he was not mentally ill  —   undercutting one of the few mitigating factors that could work in his favor  —   and left it at that. “Other than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn’t and the fact that I’m probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who’s ever existed  there’s nothing wrong with me psychologically ” Mr. Roof  who is representing himself  told the jury  which found him guilty last month of the killings at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Three minutes after walking to the lectern  Mr. Roof returned to the defense table  exhaling deeply. Any prospects for mercy by the jury had perhaps already been drained by the prosecution’s disclosure  in its opening statement  of a white supremacist manifesto written by Mr. Roof in the Charleston County jail sometime in the six weeks after his arrest. “I would like to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did ” he wrote in his distinctive scrawl. “I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. ” Mr. Roof  who was then 21  continued: “I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country and I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race. I have shed a tear of   for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place. I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed. ” As the government laid out its case for a death sentence  the prosecutor who read from the journal  Nathan S. Williams  an assistant United States attorney  told the jury of 10 women and two men that Mr. Roof’s deadly rampage was a premeditated act that had devastated the families of his victims. “The defendant didn’t stop after shooting one person or two or four or five he killed nine people ” Mr. Williams said  a few moments before he declared  “The death penalty is justified. ” Later  aided by a slide show  he described each of the victims and their lives  setting the stage for several days of   testimony by family members and friends of the victims. Mr. Williams emphasized that Mr. Roof was capable of remorse and regret  reminding jurors that he had left his mother a note of apology  but only for the pain he knew his actions would cause his own family. The presentations were a startling beginning to the trial’s sentencing phase  which is expected to run into next week in Federal District Court. On Dec. 15  after six days of testimony in which defense lawyers did not contest his guilt  the jury found Mr. Roof guilty of 33 counts  including hate crimes  obstruction of religion resulting in death  and firearms charges. Eighteen of those counts require the jury to decide whether to sentence Mr. Roof  now 22  to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. To impose a death sentence  jurors must unanimously find that aggravating factors like premeditation and the number and vulnerability of the victims outweigh any mitigating factors  like the absence of prior violent behavior and demonstrations of redemption and remorse. Mr. Roof is also facing a death penalty trial in state court. Although many people in the courtroom had already heard Mr. Roof’s flat    monotone during the guilt phase  when prosecutors played a video recording of his   confession to F. B. I. agents  his statement on Wednesday was his first to the jury. Mr. Roof chose to allow his   legal team to represent him during the guilt phase  but sidelined them during the penalty proceedings to prevent them from introducing any evidence regarding his family background or mental capacity. “The point is that I’m not going to lie to you  not by myself or through somebody else ” Mr. Roof told the jury. As his paternal grandparents watched from the second row on the left side of the courtroom  several women on the right side  which is reserved for victims’ family members  left their seats  one of them muttering curses. Mr. Roof has said he does not plan to call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf  and he did not   any of the prosecution’s witnesses on Wednesday. His approach stands in sharp contrast to the strategy of Justice Department lawyers  who have said they may call more than 30 witnesses  including at least one survivor of the attack  family members of the victims and federal law enforcement officials. Prosecutors began Wednesday with the widow of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney  the church’s slain pastor  and his two best friends. Jennifer Benjamin Pinckney  who was married to Mr. Pinckney for 15 years  narrated an affectionate and often lighthearted telling of their life together  illustrated by dozens of photographs of her husband  —   as a young saxophone player in a school band  attending the births of their two daughters  vacationing on Caribbean cruises and on a trip to Seattle. She described him as a   preacher who extended his ministry as “a voice for the voiceless” to his work in the South Carolina Legislature  where he served first in the House and then the Senate. Often exhausted by his dual roles  he was depicted in several pictures as having fallen asleep in the back seat of the family car and on a couch while reading to his daughters. “He was the person that I think every mom would be happy that her daughter would marry ” Ms. Pinckney  a school librarian  said. “He was that great catch. ” Ms. Pinckney also described her terror on the night of June 17  2015  as she and the couple’s younger daughter  Malana  then 6  listened to the gunfire from their hiding place beneath a desk in her husband’s study. As her husband and the others were gunned down in the adjacent church fellowship hall  Ms. Pinckney struggled to keep her daughter quiet and still. “I was just like  ‘Shh  shh  shh ’ ” Ms. Pinckney said  “and I put my hand over her mouth  and she was holding on to me  and she put her hand on my mouth. ” “Mama  is Daddy going to die?” her daughter asked  Ms. Pinckney said. She said the hardest thing she had ever done was telling her two daughters early the next morning that their father had been killed. Ms. Pinckney said she had heard Mr. Roof try to open the door to the study  which she had locked when the shooting began. Another assistant United States attorney  Julius N. Richardson  asked why she thought she had been spared. “It wasn’t my time ” Ms. Pinckney answered. “I couldn’t see God taking both parents away from two small kids. ” The Rev. Kylon Middleton  an A. M. E. minister who had known Mr. Pinckney from childhood  described his lifelong friend as immensely precocious (he began preaching at 13) and strategically ambitious (he aspired to be both a bishop and  perhaps  the state’s first   governor). In addition to Mr. Pinckney  the victims were the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor  49 Cynthia Hurd  54 Susie Jackson  87 Ethel Lee Lance  70 Tywanza Sanders  26 the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr. 74 the Rev. Sharonda   45 and Myra Thompson  59. Near the end of the day  Ms. Thompson’s widower  the Rev. Anthony B. Thompson  the vicar of a Reformed Episcopal Church here  told jurors about their   marriage  their anniversary date to a beach  his wife’s determined demeanor and her commitment to the historic congregation. In testimony that was mixed with laughter and tears  Mr. Thompson recounted their final day together as she prepared for the evening study of the Gospel of Mark. “She had her glow ” he said. “I mean  this smile on her face. She was radiant. I just kept looking at her. ” Word of a shooting came hours later  and Mr. Thompson rushed to the church. He demanded to know whether she had been injured or killed. He eventually found out. “My whole world was gone ” he said. “I literally did not know what to do. Everything I did was for her  and she was gone. What am I here for? If she’s gone 1.0 "ISTANBUL  —   Turkish officials accused the United States of abetting a failed coup last summer. When the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated last month  the Turkish press said the United States was behind the attack. And once again  after a gunman walked into an Istanbul nightclub early on New Year’s Day and killed dozens  the   news media pointed a finger at the United States. “America Chief Suspect ” one headline blared after the attack. On Twitter  a Turkish lawmaker  referring to the name of the nightclub  wrote: “Whoever the triggerman is  Reina attack is an act of CIA. Period. ” Turkey has been confronted with a cascade of crises that seem to have only accelerated as the Syrian civil war has spilled across the border. But the events have not pushed Turkey closer to its NATO allies. Conversely  they have drifted further apart as the nation lashes out at Washington and moves closer to Moscow  working with the Russian president  Vladimir V. Putin  to secure a   in Syria. One story in the Turkish press  based on a routine travel warning issued by the American Embassy in Turkey  was that the United States had advance knowledge of the nightclub attack  which the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for. Another suggested that stun grenades used by the gunman had come from stocks held by the American military. Still another claimed the assault was a plot by the United States to sow divisions in Turkey between the secular and the religious. Rather than bringing the United States and Turkey together in the common fight against terrorism  the nightclub attack  even with the gunman still on the run  appears to have only accelerated Turkey’s shift away from the West  at a time when its democracy is eroding amid a growing crackdown on civil society. All of this is a reflection  many critics say  of what they call the paranoia and authoritarianism of Turkey’s president  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  whose leadership has so deeply divided the country that  instead of unifying to confront terrorism  Turkish society is fracturing further with each attack. The West  symbolized by the United States  is the perennial bogeyman. While seeming to pile on the Obama administration in its waning days  —   by accusing it of supporting Turkey’s enemies  including the Islamic State Kurdish militants and supporters of an exiled Muslim cleric  Fethullah Gulen  whom Mr. Erdogan blamed for directing the coup  —   Turkish officials are also telegraphing something else: that they are willing to open the door and improve relations with the United States once   Donald J. Trump takes office. “Our expectation from the new administration is to end this shame ” Turkey’s prime minister  Binali Yildirim  said this week while accusing the United States of providing weapons to Kurdish militants in Syria who are fighting the Islamic State  but are also an enemy of Turkey. “We are not holding the new administration responsible for this ” Mr. Yildirim said. “Because this is the work of the Obama administration. ” Meanwhile  the nightclub assailant is on the loose. The Turkish authorities said on Wednesday that they had identified the killer  but refused to release any other details  although photographs of the man  from surveillance cameras  have been released. Also  a video surfaced that appeared to show the assailant recording himself in Istanbul’s Taksim Square. A senior United States official  who has been briefed on the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details  said the Turks had recovered the video from a raid on a house in Istanbul. The official said the Turks now believed the killer was from Uzbekistan  not Kyrgyzstan  as many reports this week had first suggested. The official expressed alarm at the growing   in Turkey  which seems to accumulate after each crisis here  and said it put the lives of Americans in the country in jeopardy. The chaotic investigation has added to the anxiety on Istanbul’s streets  with vehicle checkpoints  night raids on houses and   helicopters. “There is significant fear in ordinary people ” said Aydin Engin  a columnist at the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet  who was detained last year as part of the government’s crackdown on the news media. “Fear prevails when it comes to going to an entertainment place  being in a crowd  going to a shopping mall  getting on the metro. ” With each passing day  public life descends deeper into what many Turks concede is a mix of darkness and seeming absurdity  with growing fears of violence and expressions of xenophobia set next to repressions on civic life. In the days before and after the nightclub massacre on the shores of the Bosporus  nationalists staged a mock execution of Santa Claus in the name of defending Islam a reporter for The Wall Street Journal was detained    and placed in solitary confinement  —   for  according to the newspaper’s account  “violating a government ban on publication of images from an Islamic State video” and a   fashion designer was beaten up at the Istanbul airport and arrested for his social media posts. “In a way  it’s basically a breakdown of order ” said Soli Ozel  a Turkish columnist and academic  seeking to explain the tumult in society. “Everyone feels entitled to do whatever they want to do and how they want to do it. ” Tugrul Eryilmaz  another longtime Turkish journalist  recalled the country’s military coup in 1980 and the crackdown on civil society that followed  and said  “I have never been in such a situation like today. ” He brought up the Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel  who was known for surreal and absurd themes. “I feel like I am in his movies ” he said. While Turkey faces a growing terrorism threat  the country is also largely at war with itself  with deep divisions along many lines  —   religion  class  ethnicity  —   that make unity difficult even in a time of crisis. Perhaps the greatest source of division is between supporters of Mr. Erdogan  about half the country  and opponents who assert that he has become too powerful. “Turkey is so deeply polarized around the powerful persona of Erdogan that  instead of asking why terror attacks are happening and how they can be stopped  the   and   blocks in the country are blaming each other ” said Soner Cagaptay  a specialist on Turkey at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “This is why I am deeply worried about Turkey and the country’s ability to stymie further terror attacks. ” Parliament voted overnight to extend by three months the state of emergency that went into effect last summer after the failed coup. The emergency grants Mr. Erdogan’s government extraordinary powers to detain perceived opponents and hold them in pretrial detention. Tens of thousands of people have either been arrested or been purged from their jobs  on suspicion of having links to Mr. Gulen  who now lives in Pennsylvania. Mr. Erdogan on Wednesday made his first public remarks since the attack on Sunday morning  a striking period of silence for a man who is normally ubiquitous in the public sphere  often giving speeches daily. Mr. Erdogan  an Islamist  rejected criticism that his government  in pushing an Islamist agenda  had deepened divisions between the secular and the pious. Many on social media  in the aftermath of the nightclub attack  noted that the Turkish government’s religious authorities had denounced New Year’s celebrations as  . “As the president of all 79 million citizens ” Mr. Erdogan said  “it is my duty to protect everyone’s rights  law and spaces of freedom. ” Mr. Erdogan  who spoke this week with President Obama in a condolence call  also told his audience what he believed Turkey  in facing so many terrorist attacks  was really up against: a plot by the West. Invoking the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and the subsequent Turkish war against Western armies and their proxies  he said "BEIRUT  Lebanon  —   For millions of Damascus residents    concerns about the direction of the war in Syria have been replaced by worries about where to get enough water to do the dishes  wash clothes or take a shower. For nearly two weeks  the Syrian capital and its vicinity have been afflicted by a water crisis that has left taps dry  caused long lines at wells and forced people to stretch whatever thin resources they can find. “When the world gets hard for us  we work something out ” said a woman in a video posted on Facebook showing how she used a   cola bottle to wash teacups. “When you cut off the water  we dig for water. When you cut off the tap  we make a tap. ” Like most of Syria’s problems  the Damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war  which has killed hundreds of thousands of people  displaced about half the country’s prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government  armed rebels and jihadist groups. While a   brokered by Russia and Turkey and announced last week has reduced overall violence across the country  it has not stopped the fighting everywhere  nor has it resolved what happens when resources needed by one side are controlled by its enemies  as appears to be the case with Damascus’s water. Historically  most of the water for the capital  which is controlled by the government of President Bashar   has come from the Barada Valley north of the city  which is controlled by rebels who want to oust Mr. Assad. The crisis began on Dec. 22  when the water stopped flowing. Each side has accused the other of damaging infrastructure near the spring  halting the flow. Antigovernment activists have posted photos online  purporting to show structures around the spring that they say were damaged by exploding barrels dropped from government helicopters. The government first accused the rebels of polluting the water  then of damaging the infrastructure. Jens Laerke  a spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian office in Geneva  said by email Tuesday that the “deliberate targeting of the water infrastructure” had caused the  . “But we are not in a position to say by whom ” he said. “The area has been the scene of much fighting  so we have not been able to access it. ” Now  5. 5 million people in Damascus and the vicinity lack water  which has raised the risk of waterborne disease  especially among children  he said. Fighting near the Barada Valley has continued despite the  . Antigovernment activists say that government forces  and fighters from Lebanon’s Hezbollah organization  have continued to attack the area in an apparent attempt to take it over. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights  which tracks the conflict from Britain through a network of contacts in Syria  said the government launched 15 airstrikes on the area Monday amid clashes between rebels and   forces. Turkey’s foreign minister  Mevlut Cavusoglu  accused the Syrian government and its allies on Wednesday of violating the   saying that the new violence could derail peace talks meant to be held in Astana  the capital of Kazakhstan  on Jan. 23. Rebel groups have threatened to boycott the talks if government attacks do not stop. Few Damascus residents expect much from the talks or have time to think about them. While generally safe from the violence that had reduced other parts of the country to rubble  they were struggling through a cold winter of high prices and scarce commodities before the water crisis  making things worse. The Syrian government has sought to ease the crisis by trucking water from wells around the city  and the United Nations has rehabilitated 120 wells to cover about   of the city’s daily needs  Mr. Laerke  the spokesman  said. But many residents said they had received nothing. Some were buying water from men with private tankers  while others took advantage of whatever they could get. A    shopkeeper said he had not had a shower in 10 days but that he and his sons went to the mosque every day to wash their hands  feet and faces  an option not available to the women of the house. At home  he said  they used plastic utensils because they could not wash dishes. One    woman said she had not had running water in her home for 10 days. Her two sons have spent hours each day lining up to fill jugs from the well at their mosque. They use that to drink and to wash dishes  collecting the runoff to flush the toilet. “My family’s dream is to get a warm shower ” she said  speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions for communicating with a foreign news outlet without government permission. “It has become our ultimate hope in Damascus to have enough water to take showers and wash clothes in the automatic washing machine. ” She expressed anger that Syria’s   news media had said little about the water crisis  instead focusing on the military’s battles with rebels. “We are fed up with the news of military operations ” she said. “We want news about water and water supply schedules. ” Despite the water crisis  conditions in Damascus are far better than those in Aleppo  the northern city and former commercial epicenter of the country  where Syrian and Russian forces prevailed last month after prolonged bombardments of its eastern side. While the   appears to be holding there  the formerly   eastern quarters are abandoned wastelands  United Nations relief officials said. “Nothing prepared us for what we saw ” Sajjad Malik  the United Nations acting humanitarian coordinator for Syria  told reporters Wednesday in a telephone briefing from Aleppo. “The infrastructure was destroyed in almost every neighborhood. ” Mr. Malik said more than 100 United Nations relief workers from several agencies were helping civil defense teams remove debris and provide emergency food  water  shelter and medical care in the city  where four million people once lived. He estimated that 1. 5 million people remain in Aleppo  mostly on the western side  including roughly 400  000 Syrians displaced from other areas. He also said thousands of displaced residents from the eastern side were starting to return  even if their homes and businesses were badly damaged or destroyed. “They’re beginning to talk about rebuilding their lives and livelihoods  our No. 1 pick for this year’s 52 Places to Go list  spans millions of square miles. It also contains multitudes  not just of people and locations  but of memories. We asked five Canadian authors to reflect on places that have lodged in their psyches. My mother always kept a bright yellow hard hat in her car  an unexpected accessory for a petite Hong Kong immigrant in her  . She was the senior purchaser for a British Columbia forestry company that  in lean years  laid off everyone in her department except her. (More’s the pity she dreamed of early retirement.) In the meantime  she shuttled between the province’s pulp and paper mills  doing the job of six people  negotiating contracts for hotels  log loaders  harvesters and more. One year  when I was 25  I finally said yes to her persistent invitations to tag along. She wanted me to meet the men and women who earned their living in the mill towns  and who called her by her English name  Matilda. We set out in her car  exploring the    of Vancouver Island  heading for the northern tip  Port Hardy. This would turn out to be the last trip we took together. I remember the wet October chill eagles descending over corridors of evergreens a seemingly endless highway. At twilight  the world took on the shifting depths of an Emily Carr painting. I had to put up with my mother’s terrible driving  and her devotion to Celine Dion. She had to put up with my moods. I was going through a breakup and had decided that  in order to strengthen my moral fiber  I should camp  alone  for three days in the woods. I instructed my mother to drop me off at my campsite  work for a few days in Port Hardy  and then pick me up again. Port Hardy is a microcosm of Canada: a   town with a complex human and environmental history. The archaeological site of the island’s oldest known human habitation (circa 5850 B. C.) the area is the place of origin for the Kwakiutl peoples. The land of the Kwakiutl  whose name translates to “smoke of the world ” was taken into ownership  —   both private and national  —   by gunpoint  dishonored treaties and restrictive and discriminatory laws. The scramble for artifacts and the theft of Kwakiutl art  —   work that was celebrated by Claude   as among the most sophisticated in the world  —   has meant that much of the community’s historical work is housed in museums elsewhere. After 1849  the Kwakiutl population was decimated  but it survives. In 2013  British Columbia was found to have once again breached the Kwakiutl’s 1851 Treaty rights. This is not a history I learned in school. Alone in the woods  I pitched my tent. The dark fell suddenly. I made it five hours before calling my mom  telling her I was afraid  and asking her to come get me. That night  we shared a bed in a small lodging provided by her company. I smelled of the fire I had briefly managed to start. It felt good to lie beside my mother in a place that was complex and old. A little over a year later  my mother died suddenly in a town where she was working  much like this one  on a November night when her heart gave out. It was her   two kind forestry men who  worried about my mother  entered her hotel room in the morning  to find her gone. So peaceful  they told us  as if she were only sleeping. Fourteen years later  I understand better how the smoke of the world is never still. Many of the mills my mother visited have closed  jobs have been lost  and  as of a decade ago  a staggering 75 percent of Vancouver Island’s productive   forest has been logged. It is a place that will tell us much about the balance between jobs and environmental stewardship  about our respect for First Nations treaty rights and our obligations to the land. This is the Canada still to come. Madeleine Thien is the author of “Do Not Say We Have Nothing. ” Grindstone Island is a   dot of green leaves and Victorian gingerbread structures in the middle of Big Rideau Lake  halfway between Kingston and Ottawa.   in the 19th century to make way for its eponymous grindstone quarry  the island later became the summer home of Charles Kingsmill  the first admiral of the Royal Canadian Navy  and served as a genteel hub for Ottawa society life. Kingsmill’s daughter  Diana  who had a lifelong association with pacifist Quakers  took over Grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center  staging legendary   games that recreated the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment as a way to train the “prisoners” to fight oppression with noncooperation  —   a practice that ended after a disastrous fake “invasion” by a local biker gang retained for the purpose. I came to Grindstone as a young teenager in the   attending the annual summer camps run by the nonprofit cooperative the Quakers put together to manage the island. The camps’ explicit mission was to train a new generation of activists  another step on the ladder that they had climbed  through trade unionism  farmers’ unions  suffragism and feminism  to antiwar activism. Grindstone was full of kids like me:   babies who attended alternative public schools in Toronto  Kingston and Ottawa  who could rhyme the classic protest chant “   ” with the facility of lifelong practice. Today it sounds hopelessly idealistic. But in the ’80s  Grindstone was a perfect incubator for young activists. With its quiet paths  crisp lake swimming and isolated spots with names like Moonwatcher’s Point  the Grindstone experience was one part lazing around and chatting  one part intense  practical instruction. The Victorian cottages we slept in had once housed the political elites of Ottawa society and their celebrity friends. Now they were ours. I’ve always been an early riser  and it was on Grindstone that I became addicted to sunrises  swimming around the island to catch them on the still lake amid the loon calls  then rushing in a shiver back to my cabin to change for breakfast and morning meeting on the broad  shaded porch of the main lodge. As I graduated out of the summer camps  I became active in the maintenance and management of the island  volunteering in the kitchens and serving on the  ’s board. When the  ’s finances crashed with the   recession  we sold the island to a dentist from Kingston who planned to commute by small pontoon plane. I was devastated. Today  Grindstone is the private home of David Bearman and Jennifer Trant  —   museum technology pioneers who fell in love with the island the first time they saw it  immediately dissolved their successful consultancy and took up residence there  running small conferences for people interested in museums and the web. Five years ago my family and I were their guests. The island felt haunted by the ghosts of the friends I’d made there and the dreams we’d shared. It has been 25 years since I left Grindstone on its final weekend as a social justice education center  and not a week goes by without my yearning for it with a kind of joy and sorrow that is sunk very deep in my heart. I visit it in my dreams  and in the photo feeds from its current owners when I see them at museum conferences  I demand to know all the minutiae of the island’s upkeep  which trees survived the winter storms and what color they’re painting the porch this year. I live in Burbank  Calif. now  and I take my    daughter on hikes in the nearby mountains. Sometimes  when we sit on a trailside boulder and listen to the winds soughing in the trees  I can almost pretend that I’ve brought her back to Grindstone  the place I had always assumed I would raise my own family. Cory Doctorow is the author of the forthcoming novel “Walkaway” and a special adviser to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 is a delightful    turboprop relic of an airplane  with metal everywhere you expect plastic  made to land on gravel or ice. Nestled in a Hawker  I flew north from Whitehorse  Yukon’s capital city  past 300 miles of moonscape  —   gray craters scarred by the white lines of mining roads that seemed to loop and go nowhere  —   before Dawson City appeared through a hole in the cloud cover. The subarctic town  nicknamed “Paris of the North” during the late   Gold Rush  looked like a strange  solitary incursion on the land. I was there to spend three months living in the childhood home of the Canadian writer Pierre Berton  who had donated the house for this purpose. A volunteer picked me up at the   airport. On the drive through town  we passed a truck with an animal carcass in the bed  antlers poking out past a tarp.   black birds pecked at the exposed edges. “If you leave your moose out  the ravens will get at it ” the volunteer said. The Yukon River divided the town into Dawson proper and West Dawson  a scattered community of   cabins whose inhabitants hauled their own wood  water and propane. I walked down to the river almost every day. It was October  and the black  bottomless water flowed fast toward Alaska. Over the next few weeks  the river changed. First the water took on the faint sheen of an oil slick. Then slivers of ice began to race along the current  catching the light like the heads and bellies of surfacing seals. Then bigger    chunks of ice formed  audibly colliding and jostling for space until they clustered and   at a bottleneck bend. Finally  one morning in November  I woke to an eerie  noticeable silence. I went down to the river’s beach sheets of ice overlapped where they’d heaved onto the shore  their exposed   resembling massive blocks of turquoise glass. A government employee had drilled into the ice and laid out orange flags indicating where the ice was thick enough to walk safely. I watched a dogsled cross. Because of the snow cover  it wasn’t immediately clear where the ground ended and the river began. As I stepped out  I could hear ice continuing to crack  the sound of trickling water running in open rivulets. Under my feet  I’d been told  ran water deep enough to swallow a truck. This would be a stupid way to die  I thought. Halfway across  I stopped and looked south  toward where the Yukon River met the Klondike River. At this time of year  the sun rose so late and set so early that it circled the horizon in a continuous blaze of orange. Part of the Canadian identity is that we’re a hardy people  thriving in the inhospitable north. It’s one of those myths so ingrained and pervasive that you believe it even if  like me  —   like most  —   you have lived your whole life in cities less than 60 miles north of the American border. For just a moment  my breath clouding around me  icicles forming on my chin  I stood in that mythical Canada. I crossed and hiked triumphantly around West Dawson  which had been inaccessible except by helicopter during the  . The temperature dropped below   degrees Celsius. When I returned to the house  hours later  I peeled off my jeans and saw that my thighs  like my cheeks and nose  were a raw  violent red. Out on the river  I had seen two other people crossing. The first glided past on   skis with a baby strapped to his chest. The second was an acquaintance pulling a sled. “Just picking up my mail!” he called. Kim Fu is the author of the novel “For Today I Am a Boy” and the poetry collection “How Festive the Ambulance. ”  Hans Johann was a capitalist pig farmer  a man who owned the pigs and the farm. His wife was Barbara. They were both German Mennonites. After World War II  both had fled with their families from what was once Prussia to Niagara  which is where  on some acres between the lake and the waterfalls  they stayed and became Mama and Papa  then Oma and Opa. My mother  Linda  was the fourth of Oma and Opa’s seven children  born and christened at such a rate that the family could not afford middle names. Mama made up for this by calling me “Sarah Nicole ” while my father  one of four from the suburbs  has never said anything but “Sarah. ” At home in London  Ontario  I sided with my dad  thinking two names were less smart than one but when we went to the pig farm  my name was turned by thick German tongues into “   . ” This older  extrinsic version of me was the one I liked best. Summers belonged to Niagara. Driving to the farm in a station wagon with no empty seats  we knew we were close when the asphalt turned to dirt and had arrived when the dirt turned to gravel. A long lane    in birches  led to an ancient Mercedes or two and a big John Deere tractor  a nameless cat curled under the exhaust pipe. In the kitchen  we ate Oma’s bread with havarti cheese and   summer grapes  on which a skim of dust belied a   of gold. What did we need money for? Nothing. Ice cream  maybe  if we wanted it in a cone from Avondale Dairy. Turtles swam with us in the pool  the water cold and unchlorinated under scum  colored the dim vegetative green of fairy tales before they’re Americanized. Oma said her ferns would grow better if we urinated in the soil  and we rolled our eyes but did it  one at a time. I sneaked away to the gully  read my aunt’s ahistorical romance novels. My brother shot a dove with a BB gun. Pigs screamed in the barn. It seemed in those summers impossible that the sun could either burn me or fail to wake me up  that I could ever be sick for more than three days or have an allergy. I was no more friends with nature than I was friends with my kin  yet it seemed that nature and I felt the same way: indifferent to the rules  remote no matter how we were tamed. My grandfather is alive  freshly widowed. Though he no longer capitalizes on much or practices animal husbandry  he lives in the bungalow on the farm and makes and sells peach and grape jam. Everyone thinks they know what peach and grape jam taste like  but I maintain that Opa’s jam can make you forget what a fruit is. Sarah Nicole Prickett is a writer in New York and the founder of Adult Magazine.  A few years ago  I got to pick a small village to stay in for a while and write poetry. I chose the Missisquoi Valley  in the Eastern Townships of Quebec  because I liked what the bay’s First Nations name meant: many aquatic birds. Indeed  I saw birds everywhere: in my dreams  above my head  through the windows. I saw the wind  too  moving across the cornfields. The region also brought me back to my love of New England. When choosing the town I was to stay in  I’d randomly pointed at a little village called Mystic. It was an enticing name. I’d also found a sister city in the United States with the same name  which had a museum with a room dedicated to Herman Melville. When I write  I always let myself be led by coincidence. I quickly started inventing connections between Melville and the Québécois Mystic between me scribbling notes in a rented Cavalier and the trailblazers of real and fictional territory that were the great American writers of the 19th century. I also imagined stories of the devil whirling around in the town’s   barn  and created my own private numerology. I would look for covered bridges on the road  round barns built by utopian Quakers and Victorian houses. I thought about loyalists fleeing north after the Revolutionary War  about Irish Catholics fleeing famine  about all the immigrants who left their mark along the path. I knew that by venturing further  to the shores of the great Lake Memphremagog  I would also think about the Vietnam War deserters who’d found refuge there. I thought about the First Nation Abenakis  how they named the lakes and rivers  and about our ignorance. I began my stay at Pike River  but I understood that this road was one where each stop would lead to another. I walked into the office of tourism in Stanbridge Station  my next stop  and asked a petite historian a thousand questions. She showed me Chemin St.  on the map  which she called the second prettiest road in Quebec. (I never learned where the first was.) I didn’t stay in Mystic. As soon as I caught sight of the old cemetery in Hunter Mills  I became fascinated by the border zone between Quebec and the United States. It represented the state I was in myself: a wandering state of mind  looking for ghosts  mine and others’ looking for my words  my promised land  my house built stone by stone throughout my life. And that is how  having been asked to stay in a small village  I found myself gathering the rosary beads of hamlets strung along the border area. I’m still enamored with the scenery I found there: isolated villages in the shadow of the mountains  whose grandeur lorded over long lakes and rivers farms and cornfields a Mercedes up on four blocks amid the junk strewn in front of an abandoned house old   cemeteries that pop up at every turn leafy trees of maple  walnut  beech  oak  birch a few wayside crosses old churches and train stations and checkpoints and in the morning  at the inn by the river  a little black cat sitting on a tree branch listening to the sound of the falls and the purring coffeepot.

En français: Il y a quelques années  on m’a demandé de séjourner dans un petit village de mon choix afin d’y écrire des poèmes. J’ai choisi la vallée de la Missisquoi dans les cantons de l’est en Québec  parce que j’aimais la signification du nom donné par les Premières Nations à la baie: beaucoup d’oiseaux aquatiques. Déjà  je voyais des oiseaux partout  dans mes rêves  autour de ma tête  derrière les fenêtres. Je voyais aussi le vent bouger à travers les champs de maïs. Cette région me ramenait aussi à mon amour de la  . Afin de choisir le village de mon séjour  j’avais pointé mon doigt sur un petit village appelé Mystic. Ce nom m’attirait. J’avais aussi découvert une ville homonyme aux   où il y avait  dans un musée  une salle dédiée à Melville. Je me laisse toujours guider par les coïncidences pour écrire. J’inventais d’ores et déjà des liens entre Melville et le Mystic québécois entre moi prenant des notes dans une Cavalier louée  et ces défricheurs de territoires réels et fictifs que sont les grands écrivains américains du 19e siècle. J’imaginais aussi des histoires de diable tournant en rond dans la Grange à douze côtés  et créais une numérologie intime à moi. Je chercherais les ponts couverts sur la route  les granges rondes construites par des quakers utopiques  les maisons à façade victorienne je pensais à la fuite des loyalistes vers le nord  aux Irlandais catholiques fuyant la famine  à tous ces immigrants ayant laissé leurs traces sur le chemin. Je savais qu’en m’aventurant plus loin  aux abords du grand lac Memphrémagog  je penserais aussi aux déserteurs de la guerre du Vietnam. Je pensais aux Abénaquis des Premières Nations  qui ont donné les noms aux lacs et aux rivières  à notre ignorance. À   là où mon séjour commençait  j’ai compris cependant que j’étais sur une route où chaque arrêt menait à un autre. Je suis entrée dans le bureau du tourisme  j’ai posé mille questions à une petite historienne de Stanbridge Station. Elle m’a indiqué sur la carte où se trouve Chemin   la deuxième plus belle route du Québec. (Je n’ai pas jamais appris où se situe la première). Et je ne suis pas restée à Mystic: dès que j’ai aperçu le vieux cimetière de Hunter Mills  c’est la zone frontalière entre le Québec et les   qui m’a fascinée. Elle était l’illustration de l’état dans lequel je me trouvais  dans l’esprit de l’errance  à la recherche de fantômes  les miens  ceux des autres à la recherche de mes mots  ma terre promise  ma maison construite pierre après pierre tout au long de ma vie. Et c’est ainsi qu’appelée à séjourner dans un petit village  je me suis retrouvée à ramasser les grains d’un chapelet de hameaux dispersés sur le chemin de la frontière. Le décor que j’y ai trouvé m’enchante toujours: villages enclavés dans l’ombre des montagnes  dont le grandeur veillaient sur les lacs longs et les rivières fermes et champs de maïs une Mercedes sur quatre blocs à travers le débarras devant une maison à l’abandon de vieux cimetières   qui surprennent à chaque détour des arbres feuillus  érables  noyers  êtres  chênes  bouleaux quelques croix de chemin d’anciennes gares et églises  de vieux postes de frontière et le matin  à l’auberge  the Travel section presents its annual Places to Go issue. You will likely have some questions: How did the No. 1 spot get there? Why is my favorite spot not on the list? What’s the deal with those 360 videos online at nytimes. ? Here are some frequently asked questions about how we chose our 52 Places to Go in 2017.  What made Canada the top choice? And why would you choose a country?  Canada has it all (O. K. maybe not tropical beaches). It’s a world unto itself  with Vancouver Island surf breaks  culinary delights in Toronto and Montreal  and natural glories of parks like Banff in Alberta. And  let’s face it  clichés of Mounties and hockey aside  Canada remains a terra incognita for Americans and much of the world. It’s a great time to correct that  as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary this year (which means free admission all year to those national parks) and currently offers a generous exchange rate with the United States dollar. What is special about the list online? And in print? Look at the interactive version of the list on a computer or mobile device and you’ll notice a bunch of 360 videos that allow you to explore some of these places in a newly immersive way. “Travel is a great match for 360 videos because the medium provides a vivid sense of place ” said Maureen Towey  the senior producer for 360 News at The New York Times. “We ask our shooters to be adventurous in their camera placement. When they ask if they can rig the camera to a motorcycle  a   balloon or a ski lift  we say yes every time. ” On a computer  you’ll also notice a stunning drone video  shot in Tofino  on the western coast of Vancouver Island. “After many wet days  there was one morning the clouds broke and the waves were a bit better ” said Josh Haner  a staff photographer who shot the footage. “As my drone’s batteries were running out  I looked to the right and a beautiful rainbow filled the beach. It was a spectacular 45 minutes. ” And print readers will notice something new as well: a special   presentation of the list that can be removed from the section and pored over (or hung on the wall). How do you start the process? We ask our regular contributors  many of whom live overseas or roam the globe  for ideas. We get hundreds of them. What are you looking for in those ideas? First  why now? That is  why is this the year to go to a particular place? We also aim for a geographic and thematic diversity. And we look for a mix of destinations both   and off the beaten path. (That means we often exclude the very obvious spots even though cities like London  Berlin and Tokyo are always exciting  they didn’t make this year’s list.) How do you narrow it down to the final list? A   meeting  in which we discuss each idea. We get pretty punchy toward the end but are always happy with the final list. My favorite destination didn’t make the list. Why not? The 52 places we select are  of course "Whether the music to your ears is pop  classical  jazz  country or another type of tune altogether  the rhythms of 2017 have you covered. Dance the days and nights away at Summerfest  June 28 to July 9 in Milwaukee  an   bonanza that includes 800 acts spread out across 11 stages at Henry Maier Festival Park on Lake Michigan. The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pink are among the headline performers this year  the festival’s 50th  but other genres such as   classic rock  Latin and reggae are also represented. The Monterey International Pop Festival  June 16 to 18 in Monterey  Calif. is also turning 50 this year  and celebrating in style  on the same weekend and at the same location  —   the Monterey County Fair and Events Center  —   where the original festival was held in 1967. That event helped establish the careers of many legendary musicians  including Jimi Hendrix  the Who and the Grateful Dead  and this year  over the course of three days  nine bands will take the stage to pay tribute to them. In Monte Carlo  it’s all jazz all the time at the 12th annual   Jazz Festival (November and December  exact dates to be determined) featuring performances by the world’s top jazz players such as Manu Katché  the drummer and singer  the bassist Richard Bona  and Ibrahim Maalouf  the trumpet player  all of whom were guests in 2016. The heart of the action takes place at the Opéra Garnier   an ornate   building  but the shows spill over into the Casino de   and glitzy oceanfront bars. Mellower sounds are in store on the Caribbean island of Mustique from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1  at the Mustique Blues Festival  a   secret among discerning fans. The event unfolds over nearly two weeks at the beachside Basil’s Bar  where spectators can sip sundowners while listening to the music of renowned blues players from around the world  including the San   guitarist and singer Joe Louis Walker. Festivalgoers should be on the lookout for other attendees  both famous and not  giving impromptu shows Mick Jagger and Michael Kors have jumped on stage in past years to belt out the blues before a stunned crowd.
