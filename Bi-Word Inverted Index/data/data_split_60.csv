1.0 "For Megyn Kelly  the shift from Fox News to NBC  —   where she will host a daily daytime show and a Sunday newsmagazine program  —   will be a test of whether she can connect with a broader audience in a different format and reach another level of television stardom. But her move  announced Tuesday  has broader implications for the television news industry  raising new questions about the future of Fox News  where she was a countervailing presence in an opinion lineup heavy with   ideology  and of NBC News  which has been a longtime bête noire for conservative press critics. And it comes as all news organizations gird for a new era of media coverage that arrives Jan. 20 with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. The Murdoch family  which controls Fox News’s parent company  21st Century Fox  had become so invested in Ms. Kelly as a franchise that they were prepared to pay her a salary of more than $20 million a year. People inside and outside the network widely took that to mean the Murdochs were staking the network’s future on a journalist who effectively made her name by upending the expectations for a Fox News anchor  —   for instance  by publicly taking on the Republican nominee for president. But now Fox News  long the cable news ratings leader and an influential voice in the national political debate  is on course to begin coverage of a new administration with no   anchor with Ms. Kelly’s history of challenging Mr. Trump. Her show  “The Kelly File ” was sandwiched between the   program of Bill O’Reilly  —   she was regularly second to him in the cable news ratings  —   and that of Mr. Trump’s major booster  Sean Hannity. Her departure  coming after that of Greta Van Susteren  also means that Fox faces the prospect of having no female host in prime time. That is a potentially troubling development for the network as its seeks to move past last summer‘s sexual harassment scandal involving its   and former chairman  Roger Ailes  in which many women described experiencing harassment or intimidation. (Fox is said to be looking at several potential female successors for Ms. Kelly.) For NBC  the addition of Ms. Kelly  46  may help address a challenge confronting many major news organizations: connecting with a politically diverse audience. In bringing Ms. Kelly to NBC  Andrew Lack  the chairman of the news division  is adding a journalist schooled in the preferences and worldviews of the conservative Americans who helped elect Mr. Trump  and whose anger so many news organizations failed to appreciate. Ms. Kelly’s closely watched career move capped months of drama in the political sphere  in which she was often at the center of Mr. Trump’s intense    campaign  and in the media world  where she became a key figure in the events that led to Mr. Ailes’s ouster. Ms. Kelly was the most prominent among a group of women at the network who told internal investigators that Mr. Ailes had engaged in inappropriate behavior. (Mr. Ailes has denied all the accusations.) Despite having made a generous offer to Ms. Kelly  Rupert Murdoch  an executive chairman of 21st Century Fox  whose   negotiation tactics are legendary  offered a supportive statement about her decision to leave. “We thank Megyn Kelly for her 12 years of contributions to Fox News ” the statement read. “We hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family the best. ” Though the loss of Ms. Kelly is a blow to Fox News  the network has a winning formula that has kept it atop the ratings for many years  and helped it to avoid the   its rivals experienced in the weeks after Election Day  as The Associated Press reported. And now the nation has a new Republican president whose approach speaks to the sensibilities of many of Fox’s viewers. Company executives said the Murdochs knew Ms. Kelly was a flight risk their offer included keeping her in prime time  and she had made it clear she was seeking a job that would give her more time for her family. Ms. Kelly had spoken with top executives at ABC News  CNN and in the syndication industry  as well as NBC News  but NBC remained largely under the radar as a landing spot. One person briefed on Ms. Kelly’s deliberations said that Mr. Lack won her over by starting the talks with a question about what she was seeking  instead of flatly offering possibilities. He then came back with a deal that was tailored to her preferences. A daytime show would give her a schedule that would allow her to see her children off to school and to have dinner with them and her husband  Douglas Brunt  a novelist. People briefed on the talks  who spoke on the condition of anonymity  declined to disclose what Ms. Kelly’s new annual salary would be at NBC. Fox News rivals who sought to hire Ms. Kelly away  including NBC News  had indicated that they could not match the $20 million offer from Fox  the cable news leader for the last 15 years running. But even a modest raise for Ms. Kelly would place her among television’s   journalists. The Wall Street Journal recently reported she was to collect $15 million for the final year of her contract. Her high price tag was worth it for Mr. Lack  who took over leadership of NBC News and MSNBC in 2015  14 years after he had ended an   tenure running the divisions. Executives at NBC Universal turned to him to stabilize the network after the suspension of the nightly news anchor Brian Williams for embellishing accounts of his reporting in Iraq  and as MSNBC floundered in the ratings. Among his moves since returning has been to direct MSNBC back toward more traditional  hard news coverage during its daytime hours  —   like its cable news rivals  it hit record ratings highs last year  —   and away from its yearslong market position as a   answer to Fox News  which at times colored the reputation of its sister  NBC News. Ms. Kelly will not be reporting for MSNBC  which still has     hosts like Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O’Donnell. In a brief interview  Mr. Lack said he would be closely involved in the creation of Ms. Kelly’s daytime show  which will run Monday through Friday at a time to be determined  as well as the one she will anchor on Sunday nights. That show will be in the vein of CBS’s “60 Minutes ” where Mr. Lack worked early in his career. “The thing about this that is challenging but exciting as hell is that we love making new shows ” he said. “You don’t get that opportunity that often any more  and you don’t get the opportunity to do that with a talent like Megyn. ” Yet the move has its risks for all involved  especially the daytime program. Daytime television has been notoriously difficult for news stars. People involved in the discussions said that the program was not planned to be in the mold of a traditional daytime talk show  nor much like the     special Ms. Kelly hosted last May on the Fox broadcast network  which drew some harsh criticism (some of which Ms. Kelly dismissed as liberal disappointment over a friendly interview with Mr. Trump). In an interview with Charlie Rose on “CBS Sunday Morning” last year  Ms. Kelly described the television show of her fantasies. “How about if we merge a little Charlie Rose  a little Oprah  and a little me all together ’’ she said. “And we serve that up as an hour? Wouldn’t you watch that?” Ms. Kelly kept a relatively low profile on Tuesday  addressing her own news at the end of that night’s edition of “The Kelly File. ” “This was a tough decision for me ” Ms. Kelly said "Megyn Kelly’s new office at NBC News sits a block north of Fox News headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. But it might as well be a world away. In switching networks at a pivotal point in her career  Ms. Kelly  the No.   personality in cable television news  is taking a calculated risk that she can swap her dedicated Fox audience for the broader  but more fickle  viewership of network television. There are challenges from the  . Her splashy arrival has the potential to fray nerves among the big personalities at the network  —   who already compete against one another for interviews and scoops. Ms. Kelly  46  will also be taking on a daytime talk show format that has been a virtual graveyard for television news personalities in the last 10 years. And the new Sunday newsmagazine show that NBC plans to build around Ms. Kelly will go up against a giant that has not been meaningfully challenged for decades: “60 Minutes” on CBS. Still  Ms. Kelly is a bona fide star with a   book and a breakout role in this year’s presidential campaign  when she clashed with Donald J. Trump. NBC News comes out the winner in one of the most closely watched talent sweepstakes in years  acquiring one of television’s biggest names who could play a role in any number of major network events  like coverage of elections or the Olympics. Interviews on Tuesday with network executives and producers  —   from Fox  NBC and other rival channels  —   suggest that Ms. Kelly’s performance at NBC will be as closely watched in the industry as her past few months of contract negotiations. Ms. Kelly will have to design her daytime talk show from scratch. Even though she made her name as a news anchor  she has argued that she is not obsessed with politics. When she hosted a   special on Fox in May  —   her first major foray outside cable news  —   she expressed a desire to combine the qualities of Oprah Winfrey  Barbara Walters and Charlie Rose. That special  —   which featured interviews with Mr. Trump  the celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro and the actress Laverne Cox  —   received middling reviews. It was far from a ratings hit: Among adults younger than 50  the demographic most important to broadcasters  Ms. Kelly’s special performed about as well as ABC’s “Beyond the Tank ” a   spinoff. A daily daytime talk show also poses risks.   talent like Jane Pauley  Meredith Vieira  Katie Couric and Anderson Cooper have taken a stab at the genre in the past  and each one failed. In Ms. Pauley’s case  NBC invested millions of dollars  but the show was yanked in 2005 after just one year. NBC said on Tuesday that Ms. Kelly’s show was expected to be closer to a news program than the typical daytime talk show  although it is unclear what exactly that will mean or how much appetite there is for news amid a landscape including shows like “Days of Our Lives ” “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “Steve Harvey. ” The audience for daytime television is also significantly more diverse than Fox’s   viewership. Starting a Sunday rival to “60 Minutes ” the   among newsmagazines  is likewise no easy task. “Rock Center ” which Brian Williams hosted  lasted two seasons. NBC’s most recent newsmagazine  “On Assignment ” ran    against “60 Minutes” over five weeks the show averaged about four million viewers  compared with more than nine million for “60 Minutes ” which broadcast two repeats during that time. (This season  “60 Minutes” is averaging more than 14 million viewers.) It is also unclear how NBC will accommodate Ms. Kelly’s show during the National Football League season  when NBC’s popular “Sunday Night Football” package includes a highly rated pregame show that begins at 7 p. m. Eastern. But Andrew Lack  NBC News’s chairman  has long had newsmagazines in his blood. In addition to overseeing a “60 Minutes” competitor on CBS in the 1980s  Mr. Lack presided over NBC in the 1990s when newsmagazines  including the network’s popular “Dateline ” dominated   lineups. Fox  meanwhile  must now set a course without one of its biggest names  as the network continues to recalibrate itself after the ouster of its chairman  Roger Ailes. Ms. Kelly’s exit from Fox News was so abrupt that it was announced on the day that the network had run a   ad in The Wall Street Journal trumpeting the ratings of its   lineup  with Ms. Kelly prominently pictured. Her departure stunned the Fox newsroom  where journalists and executives spent Tuesday afternoon speculating over which anchor might replace Ms. Kelly in the coveted 9 p. m. slot  —   and wondering if Ms. Kelly would even appear that night. When Greta Van Susteren  another veteran anchor  announced her departure in September  network representatives visited her home to tell her not to bother coming in. In the end  Ms. Kelly was granted a chance to bid farewell to Fox News viewers  —   her last show is Friday. It is not clear who will replace her. Fox News has never had an     lineup. Potential replacements being floated inside the network on Tuesday include four women who have regularly filled in for Ms. Kelly: Sandra Smith  a host of Fox’s noon show  “Outnumbered” Trish Regan  a rising star at Fox Business Network Shannon Bream  who covers the Supreme Court and Martha MacCallum  a morning anchor. Kimberly Guilfoyle  a host of “The Five” who is friendly with Mr. Trump’s circle  and Tucker Carlson  who has put up high ratings since taking over Fox News’s 7 p. m. slot  have also been suggested. Sean Hannity  whose viewership at 10 p. m. increased enormously in 2016 and has spiked since Election Day  could be moved up an hour  but his momentum in his time slot may make Fox executives reluctant to make a switch. One winner in the sweepstakes for Ms. Kelly could be CNN  even though it did not succeed in recruiting her. CNN  while still behind Fox News in total viewers by a wide margin  has occasionally beaten Fox among viewers 25 to 54  the demographic that determines advertising rates. In 2016  CNN finished within 58  000 viewers of Fox in prime time in the demographic  —   cutting Fox’s lead in half. Since the election  Fox has regained a sizable lead  but now  without spending a penny "QINGYUAN  China  —   The 48 soccer fields of the vast Evergrande Football School in south China seem barely enough for its 2  800 students. Against a backdrop of school spires that seem modeled on Hogwarts  the young athletes swarm onto the fields nearly every day  kicking  dribbling and passing in the hope of soccer glory and riches. “Soccer will be my career after I grow up ” Wang Kai  a gangly    who has studied at the boarding school for over three years  said after a morning session under the supervision of a Spanish coach. “I want to be the Chinese Cristiano Ronaldo ” he said  referring to the Portuguese superstar. Grooming the next Ronaldo or Messi has become a national project in China  where the country’s No. 1 fan  President Xi Jinping  is bent on transforming the country into a great soccer power. It is a moonshot for China  whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition. But the effort has already unleashed a surge of spending and support for the game that has stunned fans and players around the world. In the last two weeks  the main Chinese league has plucked foreign stars from Europe and South America with contracts reported to be worth as much as $40 million a year  the highest pay for any soccer player in the world. A Chinese club offered the real Ronaldo $105 million a year  but he declined  his agent said last week. These giddying sums are shaking the landscape of pro soccer. Antonio Conte  the manager of England’s fabled Chelsea team  denounced the Chinese spending spree last month as a “danger for all teams in the world. ” The drive to match China’s economic ascent with success on the soccer field has become emblematic of Mr. Xi’s ambition to transform China into a great and confident power. “My biggest hope for Chinese soccer is that its teams become among the world’s best ” he announced in 2015. In the last two years  the government has poured the kind of concentrated effort into soccer that it has previously devoted to winning Olympic medals in individual sports like diving and gymnastics. It has promised to clean up and reorganize professional soccer and build a new generation of players by creating tens of thousands of soccer fields and adding soccer programs in tens of thousands of schools. The aim is to establish a flow of top players eventually capable of winning the coveted men’s World Cup and returning the women’s team to its former glory. That effort has emboldened Chinese clubs to spend lavishly. As well as paying tens of millions for foreign players  Chinese team owners have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying into European clubs  hoping to tap their coaching and marketing expertise. “Current spending has created massive expectations ” said Simon Chadwick  a professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford in Britain. “Spending big on players is also about acquiring heroes and icons. ” But if soccer distills Mr. Xi’s national ambitions  it also illustrates how his plans could falter  as they have in other arenas  in a muddle of rushed and distorted enforcement  especially at the local level. There has been resistance by parents  worried about their children taking precious time away from academics  as well as fear that splurging on foreign stars diverts money and attention from fostering homegrown talent. The pitfalls in fixing soccer  it turns out  are a bit like those in fixing the economy a desire for quick  flashy success is putting   goals at risk. People’s Daily  the main newspaper of the Communist Party  warned last month of a “bubble” of reckless spending in Chinese professional soccer that could burst and badly damage the sport. Too many investors had feverish expectations  while some clubs  officials and schools were only going through the motions of developing young players  the newspaper said. “One of the biggest problems is ” said Cameron Wilson  a Scottish resident of Shanghai who edits Wild East Football  a website that follows the sport in China. “There are these great plans and ideas. But when it gets down to the   level in the provinces  it’s like people doing their own thing. ” China’s passionate soccer fans would be thrilled to have competitive national teams instead of the lackluster ones they have now. The national men’s team recently placed 83rd in FIFA rankings  just ahead of the Faroe Islands  a remote outcrop of Denmark with fewer than 50  000 inhabitants  and it is unlikely to win a spot in the 2018 World Cup. The women’s team  —   the pride of Chinese soccer in past decades  —   has stumbled. It was   for the Women’s World Cup in 1999 but slipped to 13th in the latest  rankings. “The national team is a joke ” said Xu Yun  16  who had come to Workers’ Stadium in Beijing to watch his favorite Beijing team clobber a listless opponent from Henan Province. “I think it will need decades to get it right. It’s not just a question of spending money  it’s attitude. ” For years  the domestic professional game was riddled with corruption  brazen even by China’s   standards. Since   revelations grew into a national scandal in 2009  the worst cheating has been cleaned up. “It still exists ” Mr. Wilson said. “Just not so blatantly. ” For Xi  soccer has been a passion since childhood. His trips abroad have included photographs with David Beckham and other soccer celebrities. In Ireland in 2012  he famously had an enthusiastic but seemingly rusty go at kicking a ball. In September  he revisited his old school in Beijing  where he learned to kick and became a fan of the game  according to memoirs of his former teacher. “Look how healthy I am ” Mr. Xi told young soccer players at the school. “I laid the basis for that through sports when I was young. ” Private investors have piled into professional soccer  encouraged by Xi’s backing for the game and apparently eager to curry favor with his government. In the main pro trading season last year  the 16 Chinese Super League teams spent about $300 million hiring away promising foreign players  outstripping player spending by the English Premier League by nearly $120 million  according to FIFA TMS  a player transfer data company. Prices in 2017 are likely to go even higher. But Mr. Xi’s focus is on the long game and the next generation of players. His plan calls for 50  000 schools to have a strong emphasis on soccer by 2025  a leap from 5  000 in 2015. The number of soccer fields across the country will grow to over 70  000 by the end of 2020  from under 11  000. By then  the plan says  50 million Chinese  including 30 million students  will regularly play soccer. “Now principals at every school are paying quite a bit more attention to soccer ” said Dai Wei  the athletic director at r. Xi’s old school  the Bayi School. “That was unthinkable before. ” Yet there is deep cultural resistance  even at Bayi. Some parents discourage their children from committing time to sports  Mr. Dai said  because they have so much homework and face stiff competition on academic exams. While China has excelled at individual sports that demand intense discipline from an early age  the country has not done as well at fostering group sports  where skills like teamwork and improvisation count as much as personal virtuosity. The privately run Evergrande school  the world’s biggest soccer boarding school  says its formula of intense training combined with a solid education could show the way for developing young players. “As more soccer schools are built  there’ll be more and more kids playing  and the stars will multiply  too ” said Liu Jiangnan  the principal of the school  which opened in 2012. “I’d guess that in seven or eight years  half the members of the Chinese national squad will come from this school. ” Drawn by such hopes  parents pay up to about $8  700 a year to send children here  where 24 Spanish coaches oversee training. Students spend 90 minutes a day on drills and also play on weekends. Promising players get scholarships  and children from poorer families get discounts  school officials said. But even here  the children come to the game later than their European and South American counterparts  and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics  said Sergio Zarco Diaz  a Spanish coach. “The kids are getting better  year by year ” he said hopefully. But the Evergrande approach is too expensive to be widely copied. Some schools  facing a shortage of coaches and space for fields  have devised their own drills  like soccer gymnastics  in which children stand in lines tossing a ball up  down and around. It may impress visiting officials  but it is scant preparation for the free flow of the game  said Zhang Lu  a widely respected soccer commentator. “Chinese soccer has failed before through rushing for instant success ” Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing  recalling previous failed efforts to build up the game in the 1980s and 1990s. “The problem is that everyone’s thinking is still deeply set in traditional ideas. Everyone thinks soccer is just about getting results  competition  training  creating stars. ” Mr. Zhang has instead been encouraging schools to focus on fun and broad participation. That approach gives more children a break from the monotony of the classroom and will eventually bring out more future champions than an elitist    approach  he argues. Some schools are trying his way. On a recent afternoon  the smog that often covers Beijing lifted and the children of Caoqiao Elementary School rushed onto the fields  shouting and squealing with delight. “This morning soccer had been canceled because of the smog ” said the principal  Lin Yanling. “But at midday I notified the kids that it was back on "In the technology industry  the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years  the biggest players in tech  —   from IBM to   to Cisco to Yahoo  —   were eventually outmaneuvered by   that came out of nowhere. The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow  blind and dumb  to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place. Then  in the last half decade  something strange happened: The sharks began to get bigger and smarter. Nearly a year ago  I argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business  one that is typified less by the storied   in a garage than by a posse I like to call the Frightful Five: Amazon  Apple  Facebook  Microsoft and Alphabet  Google’s parent company. Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year  their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible  but also maybe even probable. In 2017  much the same story remains  but there is a new wrinkle: The world’s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States  Europe  Asia and South America  the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers  and often even against popular will. The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region  including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump’s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds. This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So  happy New Year. Let’s start with some stats. In 2017  the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016  they are half of the world’s 10 most valuable companies  when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends  —   mobile phones  social networks  the web  the cloud  retail and logistics  and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs. Meanwhile  the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech  —   on autos  health care  retail  transportation  entertainment and finance. The Five aren’t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple’s sales were flat last year  and after a monster 2016  Alphabet’s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren’t entirely safe from competition from   and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot. Still  at the moment  thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a   outlook  the Five sure do look insulated from competition from   today’s most valuable tech upstarts  like Airbnb  Uber and Snap  could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five. What has changed is public perception. For years  most of the Five enjoyed broad cultural good will. They were portrayed in the news media as forces of innovation and delight  as the best that American capitalism had to offer. The exceptions were Microsoft  which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s  and Amazon  which got under people’s skin for  among other things  making books cheaper and more widely accessible  thereby hurting bookstores. But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you’re supposed to in America  —   by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren’t considered that bad. They weren’t causing environmental disasters. They weren’t selling cigarettes. They weren’t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five’s growing invincibility last year  the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn’t I called them the Fabulous Five? Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt as technology wormed deeper into our lives  it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with. Silicon Valley grew cloistered  missing people’s unease with the speed with which their innovations were changing our lives. When Apple took on the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year over access to a terrorist’s iPhone  many in tech sided with the company  but a majority of Americans thought Apple should give in. During the long presidential campaign  Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner  Jeff Bezos  was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos’s main company  Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump  but the industry’s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public. For years  most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised  —   entertainment giants  cable and phone companies  and the news media  among others. “During the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters  in general the U. S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters ” said Julius Genachowski  the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group  a private equity firm. That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years  and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them. During Mr. Genachowski’s term at the F. C. C. and then again during the term of his successor  Tom Wheeler  the commission passed rules favoring “network neutrality ” which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies. But as Mr. Genachowski noted  as the disrupters grow  the dynamic often shifts. “The next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents  and then you see two things  —   battles between incumbents and other incumbents  and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents ” he said. That’s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves  and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments  who will look to both sides of the ledger  —   their benefits to society as well as their potential costs  —   when deciding how to police them. But there’s a twist: With the Five  unlike in previous eras of tech  it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today’s  . The battles for dominance in cloud services  artificial intelligence and data mining    assistants    cars  virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five. That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power  things could be fabulous 1.0 "BEIJING  —   A city official in southwest China unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the city’s mayor and Communist Party secretary during a meeting on Wednesday  injuring them before fleeing and killing himself  the official news media reported. Privately owned guns are rare in China  because of a virtual ban on civilian use  and grisly attacks on officials by colleagues are also uncommon. So rumors of the shooting in Panzhihua  an industrial city in Sichuan Province  rippled quickly across the Chinese internet even before the local authorities confirmed the news. Panzhihua was built as part of Mao’s plans to relocate factories deep inland  where they would be protected from a feared war. But the violence in this isolated site was nonetheless an embarrassing breach of the efforts by China’s president  Xi Jinping  to remake officialdom into a clean  impeccably disciplined bureaucracy. Details were sparse  and there were no clues to the gunman’s motives. But the brief initial report in the state media sketched a scene of the head of the Panzhihua Land and Resources Bureau  Chen Zhongshu  bursting into a meeting at an exhibition center and opening fire on officials there. “The gunman stormed into the meeting  fired repeatedly at the main leading comrades of the city party committee and government and then fled ” said an online report by Sichuan Daily  an official provincial newspaper  citing the Panzhihua government press office. The suspect in the shooting  Mr. Chen  was found dead in the exhibition center. He had taken his own life  the report said without giving details. The mayor  Li Jianqin  and party secretary  Zhang Yan  were wounded and sent to the hospital  but their injuries were not considered   the report said. Mr. Zhang  the party secretary  has worked in Panzhihua since 2006  and the mayor  Mr. Li  has worked there since last year  according to Chinese news reports. Both officials went to meetings and inspection visits with Mr. Chen previously 1.0 "A steep drop in gang violence last year drove shootings in New York City to the lowest number in at least a   Police Department data shows  a result of what police officials say has been a focus on gang takedowns and targeted arrests in some of the city’s roughest neighborhoods. The internal police data  obtained by The New York Times  paints a detailed portrait of the motives  locations and circumstances behind murders and shootings for the last two years.   shootings fell to 412 in 2016  from 560 the year before  according to the data  which tracked shootings and murders through Dec. 28 of each year.   killings dropped to 79 in 2016  from 129 in 2015. Those   helped push citywide shootings to a new low of 998 by year’s end  police officials said  down from 1  138 in 2015. Murders also fell  to 335 from 352 the year before. The New York City police commissioner  James P. O’Neill  has noted the department’s efforts to push shootings below 1  000 for the first time since at least the early 1990s  when the police began keeping similar records. Mr. O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio were expected to discuss those efforts at a news conference in Brooklyn on Wednesday. Scores of gang takedowns this year  resulting in about 900 arrests  took violent people off the streets and made it more costly to engage in   crimes  police officials said. “Precision policing targets those people who are responsible for the violence  which in a significant amount of cases are gangs ” said Stephen P. Davis  the department’s chief spokesman. “By going after the gang members  arresting them  we recognize the resultant reduction in violence. ” Violent crime has been more persistent  in some communities  especially outside Manhattan. But the Police Department  in continuing to drive down crime even as it has pulled back from heavy   enforcement and aggressive tactics like    has shown the value of focusing resources on stopping serious crime  said David M. Kennedy  a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “New York City  in many ways  convinced the rest of the country that things like zero tolerance were the way to make communities safe ” he said. “And now it’s showing the country that you absolutely do not need to do that  you should not do it  and there are much  much better and less damaging ways to work with communities to produce public safety. ” The reductions in New York stand in stark contrast to some other cities  most notably Chicago  which had a sharp increase in murders and shootings in 2016 and ended the year with 762 homicides. The New York Police Department data offers a rare glimpse into the more granular ways that the department’s Detective Bureau tracks and classifies crime  as well as the   tangle of reasons that people are shot and killed. Shootings and murders dropped across almost every category of motive last year. Murders in which drugs were the primary motive  for example  dropped to 29 in 2016  from 42 the year before. But domestic killings rose slightly  to 57 last year from 49 in 2015. Criminologists believe gang enforcement can result in arrests of people who are also domestic offenders  but they say that domestic violence remains more difficult to prevent  because it can escalate inside homes  without the police being notified. Mr. Kennedy said that efforts in smaller jurisdictions across the country to respond to the earliest signs of domestic violence and to punish repeat offenders were showing results  but that those strategies would be more difficult to replicate in a city the size of New York. Fewer people were murdered with guns in 2016  but the number of people killed by cutting rose to 73  from 50 the year before. Murders and shootings on the street  in public housing and in commercial locations all dropped last year through Dec. 28. Murders on playgrounds climbed to 12  from three the year before  and also rose in dwellings and in vehicles. More broadly  murders indoors ticked up by 19  while outdoor murders fell by 49. About a third of shootings and murders occurred between 10 p. m. and 2 a. m. and more than half happened between 6 p. m. and 2 a. m. The biggest share of murders were motivated by what the police call a “dispute. ” Of those  the largest share had to do with words that were exchanged  followed by disputes over a man or woman  over money  and over a previous history. Five murders in 2016 were deemed to be motivated by a stare or a disrespectful act  two by gambling and two by road rage. Just under a third of the shooting cases last year were closed with an arrest  and 22 percent of the cases were closed because the police had exhausted all leads. Forty percent of the murder cases were closed with an arrest  and eight others were termed an exceptional clearance "Our new president is a    billionaire Ivy League graduate  a real estate tycoon  a TV star and a son of inherited wealth. But he is no longer  by his own calculations  a member of the “elite. ” Nor are the men (and the few women) now joining his inner circle  —     and corporate executives  Harvard and Yale alumni  Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and Goldman Sachs bankers. The true elite apparently sits elsewhere  among those who  in Sarah Palin’s notable 2008 formulation  think “that they’re  —   I guess  —   better than anyone else. ” As an adjective  the word “elite” still conveys something positive  even aspirational: elite athlete  elite model  elite travel services. But as a noun  embodied by actual living people  it has become one of the nastiest epithets in American politics. “Elites have taken all the upside for themselves and pushed the downside to the   and   Americans ” complains Trump’s adviser Steve Bannon (of Harvard  Goldman Sachs and Hollywood). In this formulation  elites are a destructive  condescending collective  plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks. And in these attacks  the   and his team are deploying one of the most effective partisan political stereotypes of the modern age. For most of American history    sentiment was a matter of up versus down  not left versus right. But about half a century ago  the conservative movement set out to claim   politics as its own. That meant redefining the term away from class and toward culture  where the “elite” could be identified by its liberal ideas  coastal real estate and highbrow consumer preferences. The   Club for Growth captured this type in a famous 2004 attack ad  instructing the Democrat Howard Dean to “take his           New York         freak show back to Vermont where it belongs. ” Trump adjusted the formula for the hot topics of the 2016 campaign. “I was on the right side of that issue  as you know  with the people ” he boasted after Brexit  adding that “Hillary  as always  stood with the elites. ” His complaints against “political correctness” conjure a world of absurdist campus politics  where overprivileged students squabble over gender pronouns and the fine points of racial victimization. “Media elites” come in for special attack  cordoned off in pens to be mocked and jeered at during rallies  labeled both liars and incompetents. But Trump has also ventured beyond mere   turning the 2016 election into a competition between knowledge systems: the      “people” versus the    “elites. ” His campaign insisted for months that pollsters and technocrats and media would be proven wrong by his electoral success. The fact that he did win dealt a blow to an entire worldview  one in which empirical inquiry and   were supposed to triumph in the end. The question  now  is whether it’s possible to run an executive branch based on hostility toward experts and professionals of all political stripes  —   and how many billionaires and Ivy Leaguers Trump can appoint before this rhetorical pose begins to break down altogether. The notion that distant elites might be conspiring against the people comes straight from the Founding Fathers  whose Declaration of Independence lamented the “long train of abuses and usurpations” inflicted upon ordinary Americans by an arrogant British king. From there on  United States history might be seen as a repeating cycle of   revolt. The Jacksonians rebelled against the Founders’ aristocratic pretensions. Northern “free labor” went to war against the oligarchical slavocracy. And the Populist revolts of the late 19th century adapted this story to modern capitalism  with farmers and laborers rebelling against robber barons  bankers    experts and   professionals. The first historians to study those Populists described them as heroic crusaders  champions of the “people” against the “powers. ” But by the middle of the 20th century  alarmed by the rise of fascism and homegrown demagogues like Senator Joseph McCarthy  a new generation of scholars took a more anxious view of the   spirit. In his 1955 book “The Age of Reform ” Richard Hofstadter dismissed the Populists as   provincial   the latent fascists of their day. Eight years later  his “  in American Life” documented a dangerous suspicion of “the critical mind” that seemed to course through the national culture. From his perspective  the 1952 election captured everything wrong with American political life  with Dwight Eisenhower’s “philistinism” winning over Adlai Stevenson’s “intellect. ” Hofstadter did not usually describe his ideal intellectually minded citizens as members of an “elite. ” That word conveyed something different  —   a ruling class that held direct political and economic power. The most famous articulation of this view came from the sociologist C. Wright Mills  in his 1956 assessment of America’s “power elite. ” “They rule the big corporations ” Mills wrote. “They run the machinery of the state and claim its prerogatives. They direct the military establishment. ” In Mills’s view  these people were tied together not by culture or ideology but by their positions at the helms of large     institutions. As individuals  they might be Republicans or Democrats  and might live in Ohio or California. The point was that they were in charge of things. But that vision never gained much traction in mainstream politics  where a more partisan  targeted definition was starting to emerge. William F. Buckley Jr. carved out some essentials in his first book  “God and Man at Yale ” drawing a neat distinction between respectable   men like himself and the socialistic eggheads of the professoriate. Ronald Reagan chose the term “elite” to bring it all together in his famed 1964 speech  “A Time for Choosing ” delivered on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. “This is the issue of this election ” he said: “whether we believe in our capacity for   or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a   capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. ” Lyndon Johnson won that election in a blowout  but Reagan’s vision of a smug and detached liberal elite helped spark the oncoming “culture wars ” pitting a supposedly indignant Middle America against the liberal snobs of the coasts. By the 1990s  with the rise of   media stars like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly  bashing the “liberal elite” had become a favorite blood sport of the American right. Despite all the abuse hurled their way  some “liberal elites” have accepted at least part of their detractors’ critique  particularly on the progressive left. It was during Bill Clinton’s presidency that the social critic Christopher Lasch published “The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy ” which mourned that “   liberals” had turned into “petulant    intolerant” scolds  thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of Middle America. Since then  the torch has passed to a younger generation of writers  including MSNBC’s Chris Hayes  whose 2012 “Twilight of the Elites” called for rethinking the entire ethos of liberal “meritocracy”  —   a system  he argued  that tends to fuel   and incompetence at the top while offering little but contempt and dim prospects for those at the bottom. So as 2017 begins  we find ourselves in a strange and uncertain political moment. Antipathy toward a wealthy  preening managerial class seems to be gaining popularity across the political spectrum  —   and  oddly  to have helped elect a wealthy  preening incoming president. Meanwhile  both liberal and conservative “elites” are scrambling to figure out what happens if the   continues to reject basic political norms and even routine intelligence briefings. Under a Trump presidency  such “elites” may have no choice but to attempt a radical redefinition of their role in American life. Otherwise 1.0 "“Will you marry me?” Hundreds of thousands of potential grooms and brides pop that question every year  and yet the logistics of delivering that momentous phrase  —   where to do it  when to do it and how much of a surprise should it be  —   remains among the most important decisions anyone planning on getting married has to make. Some of the couples whose wedding announcements were featured in the pages of The New York Times this past year  or whose weddings The Times learned about  got engaged in unusual spots  —   from a Manhattan rooftop to a subway construction site below the city’s streets  —   and one proposal even involved seeking advice from President Obama. And  of course  at least several can now be found on YouTube. Here are 10 of our most engaging stories of the year. Mr. Litman  who first began dating Ms. Michelis in the eighth grade at the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx  proposed in November 2015 in Montauk  N. Y. the entire scene captured by a drone hovering above on an unusually warm   day at the beach. With waves rushing the shore and the Montauk Point Lighthouse in the distance  Ms. Michelis can be seen from a windblown aerial view playfully running beneath the drone before turning back to Mr. Litman. As she runs closer  he drops to his knee  engagement ring in hand. Momentarily shocked at the sight  she drops her purse as he asks her to marry him  and the two then fall into each other’s arms. “The first thing that came to my mind was  I can’t wait to show it to our kids ” Ms. Michelis said. They were married Oct. 8. The couple first met in fall 2011 while working on the digital team for Mr. Obama’s   campaign. After the president’s victory  Mr. Fallsgraff became the digital director of Organizing for Action  the nonprofit organization that manages the social media and digital accounts for Mr. Obama. In 2015  Mr. Fallsgraff and his team were filming a video with Mr. Obama at a hotel in Washington during the Organizing for Action Spring Organizing Summit. Knowing he was planning to leave in June  Mr. Fallsgraff took the opportunity to talk with the president  and told him that he was bent on proposing (which he would do three months later). “You got a rock picked out and all that?” he recalled Mr. Obama asking. Mr. Fallsgraff told him he had yet to get the ring and asked if the president had any advice. Mr. Obama suggested that Mr. Fallsgraff get help from someone Ms. Wilson trusted and who understood her taste. When Mr. Fallsgraff suggested that he was thinking of asking Ms. Wilson’s best friend  the president responded  “I think that’s the right strategy  but you’ve got to swear her to secrecy. ” The next time Mr. Fallsgraff saw Ms. Wilson’s best friend  he pulled her aside. “I told her I had a mission for her from the president of the United States ” he said. Mission accomplished. Mr. Fallsgraff and Ms. Wilson were married July 3. The couple  who met in June 2015 through a dating app called the League  went to Paris six months later for a New Year’s celebration. While at a restaurant there  Mr. Purcell ordered a bottle of Champagne for what he thought was 110 euros  the equivalent of about $119. But when the bill arrived after dinner  he realized he had mistakenly ordered a bottle of vintage Champagne  —   the 2003 Dom Pérignon Rosé  —   at a cost of 1  100 euros  a total at the time of roughly $1  195. In May  Mr. Purcell invited Ms. Bui to the rooftop of his apartment building in San Francisco to enjoy the unobstructed   view that included the Golden Gate Bridge. As they took in the view  Mr. Purcell surprised Ms. Bui by breaking out an expensive bottle of the same vintage Champagne he had mistakenly bought in Paris. It was all a part of a special occasion  he told her  and then he surprised her again  this time with an engagement ring. They were married Nov. 26. The couple  who met in 2007 while they were working for the New York City Department of City Planning  became engaged in May 2014  when Mr. Meagher proposed while they were on a tour of the construction site of the 86th Street station  part of the Second Avenue subway. The tour  conducted below street level  included residents who live near the new subway line as well as officials with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “We’re both passionate about cities and infrastructure ” Mr. Meagher said. And about each other  as the group learned when Mr. Meagher  wearing a hard hat and an orange safety vest  got down on one knee and asked Ms. Grossman  who was wearing the same gear  to marry him. Gasps  then applause  broke out among the tour group  as well as from the bride’s parents  who had also shown up for the occasion. They were married Jan. 9. The couple met in August 2014 during a performance of the Broadway musical “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder. ” Mr. Fogelman  who was there alone  tried to move to an empty seat next to Ms. Phillips to get a better view of the stage. “Not in the middle of a song ” said Ms. Phillips  who was there with a friend. Mr. Fogelman waited until after the song to switch seats  and at intermission  he apologized profusely to her for his poor theater etiquette. She forgave him  he sat down next to her  and they began talking. They were soon dating  and in August 2015  while sitting in those same seats  Mr. Fogelman turned to Ms. Phillips at intermission and proposed. “It turned out to be a wonderful   at the theater ” Ms. Phillips said  “one that I will never forget. ” They were married Sept. 4. Mr. Whelden  a plumber in Boston who sings with two professional   touring a cappella groups (Five O’Clock Shadow and Overboard) proposed during his performance at a New Year’s Eve concert in Rockport  Mass. The crowd roared when he sang “Fall in Love ” a song he wrote for his future bride that included the words “will you marry me. ” “It was the most amazing  romantic proposal I could’ve ever imagined ” Ms. Delaney said. They were married May 7. The couple  who were both living in Park Slope  Brooklyn  met through OkCupid in early 2011. They immediately became a couple. In July 2015  they moved into a   together in Bay Ridge. On their first day in the new place  Ms. Roth put in motion her proposal while Ms. Marini was at work. She was hiding when Ms. Marini returned  and watched her follow a path of lighted candles to a makeshift bed where Chinese food boxes had been placed across the floor  leading to a smaller box. (“Melina had always idealized the movie trope of people moving into a new apartment that’s not yet furnished  and having to eat Chinese food on the floor  ” Ms. Roth explained.) When Ms. Marini opened the smaller box  which contained an engagement ring  she started sobbing. Along with the ring was a note that said: “Will you marry me? Check yes or no. ” Ms. Marini checked “yes ” and she and Ms. Roth  who came out of hiding  cried in each other’s arms. “I’m not the type of person who wants to see ‘Will you marry me?’ splashed across a Jumbotron ” Ms. Marini said. “This was much more intimate to me  and much more meaningful. ” They were married Aug. 6. The couple met on March 11  2005  while shooting pool in what Ms. Powell described as a dim  smoky bar on Avenue B in Manhattan. They shared several beers  then a single kiss outside the bar. Mr. Albertson  23 at the time  was beyond taken with her  but Ms. Powell  then 20  was not quite ready for a serious relationship. They settled on becoming friends. Ms. Powell eventually married another man  and fell out of touch with Mr. Albertson. By May 2014  however  Ms. Powell was divorced and dating Mr. Albertson  often telling him that the word “marriage” now frightened her. On March 11  2015  10 years to the day they met  they were back on Avenue B and heading into that same dim  smoky bar when Ms. Powell looked down and saw a huge chalk mark indicating the spot where she had first kissed him. She turned to find him down on one knee  holding her engagement ring. “I was freaking out ” she said. “I just started crying and hugging him. ” He proposed but managed to avoid scaring her by leaving out the word “marriage. ” “I was wondering ” he said  “if you wanted to hang out with me forever. ” They were married March 11. Mr. Turke  who proposed in February  chose to give his future bride a full day of   bliss  rather than a single moment of happiness. An hour after he sneaked out of their apartment at 6 a. m. he called her with instructions to go into their kitchen  where she found a huge bouquet of white lilies with several notes that he had left for her  including one that read  “Today is the day that we get engaged ” and another that read  “Enjoy the moments ahead of you  have fun and say ‘yes. ’” What ensued was a dizzying series of events that first took Ms. Helmling to the NoMad Hotel in Manhattan  where she found her three best friends waiting at a breakfast table. A waiter then gave them a note with instructions to walk across the street to a spa  where they each enjoyed Champagne and a massage before being whisked away for manicures and pedicures. Later in the day  Ms. Helmling was chauffeured over the George Washington Bridge to a small park in New Jersey overlooking the Hudson River  —   the spot where Mr. Turke had first asked her out in September 2013. “When she arrived  we hugged and cried and she told me all about her day ” said Mr. Turke  who also presented a slide show that included every photo that had both of them in it  arranged in chronological order as a way of telling their story. Then he proposed  and Ms. Helmling cried some more. They were married Nov. 13. The couple met online in 2008. At the time  Mr. Stucky was living in Somerville  Mass. and going through a divorce. They were soon dating  but their relationship began to sputter. In the space of three years  each of them proposed to the other  and each was soundly rejected. In June 2014  Ms. Mathiowetz was partying with friends in New York when she consumed too many psychedelic mushrooms. The episode left her paralyzed for nearly six hours  —   and longing again for Mr. Stucky  whom she was no longer seeing. “I can’t believe I haven’t been telling you every day that I love you ” she called to tell him the moment she got back on her feet. Mr. Stucky was feeling much the same way  as he too had had a   experience  he said  a nightmare in which he was on his knees and looking up at a stranger who was telling him he had only 24 hours to live. Completely shaken  he awoke and began taking into account all the things in life that mattered most to him  and quickly realized that Ms. Mathiowetz was at the top of that list. Those shared experiences brought them back together  and in January 2015  Mr. Stucky proposed to Ms. Mathiowetz  for a second time  during a weekend trip at a    in Portsmouth  N. H. This time 1.0 "Alicia Rivera  a    single mother with four children and big dreams  must budget her money and her time wisely. “I got my kids ” Ms. Rivera said. “I don’t want to waste my time. ” Ms. Rivera and her children  —   Joaquin  17 Nelson  16 Alyssa  11 and Rafael  2  —   live in a   apartment in the Bronx  near the southern tip of the Bronx River Parkway. The past few years have sometimes been overwhelming for her as she tries to raise her children by herself  get an education and lay the foundation for a professional career. When she was seven months pregnant with Rafael  Ms. Rivera injured her back while working as a home health aide. Soon after he was born  she switched to another job  helping   people navigate complicated real estate and tax forms and other paperwork. Ms. Rivera makes about $100 every week. She also receives $216 a month in Supplemental Security Income and $506 a month in food stamps. With a monthly rent of $308  she needs to keep a frugal budget. But Ms. Rivera has a plan. She is on track to receive an associate degree from Plaza College in April. Her goal is to then earn a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree  both in business  from Metropolitan College of New York. She dreams of opening a dance studio in the Bronx. Ms. Rivera grew up in the Bronx with a mother who could not afford to send her to dance classes. But she loved dancing in front of the family’s television as they watched the   variety show “Sábado Gigante. ” “And you see these kids dancing  and you see me dancing in the living room  too ” Ms. Rivera said. “I used to wear my mom’s makeup  her heels. ” Ms. Rivera passed on her love of dancing to her children  especially Joaquin  who leads a dance team at his school  the Knowledge and Power Preparatory Academy  near Fordham University in the Bronx. She watched him at a dance rehearsal at the school  and she said the students’ moves reminded her of the “Step Up” movie series. “Made me laugh  made me have a good time ” she said. “I felt like joining them ” she said  beaming. At times  Ms. Rivera has struggled to balance her obligations at home  school and work. As she devoted more time to her studies  her son Nelson  who attends the same academy as Joaquin  started having trouble at school. A counselor there contacted her  saying that Nelson did not want to go to class. The counselor referred her to the Family Assistance Program  which soon referred them to the Children’s Aid Society  one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. At Children’s Aid  Ms. Rivera said  she learned how to improve her parenting. She said she used to get frustrated and yell at Nelson when he struggled to get up and get ready in the morning. A counselor told her that yelling at him was not going to solve the problem. Therapy sessions with the family also made it clear that her sons needed their own rooms. Ms. Rivera said she started to notice positive changes at home after several months of therapy. Her older sons now have their own rooms. Alyssa agreed to share a room with her mother and Rafael. Her elder sons are more focused now. Nelson comes to her with problems  not letting them linger  and they work them out together. Joaquin is starting to research colleges. The Children’s Aid Society also provided Ms. Rivera $413 in Neediest funds to replace her sons’ broken beds with new ones. Nelson and a friend put them together  she said. While still attending school  Nelson is taking some online courses  which cost $49 a month. Ms. Rivera wants to withdraw Nelson to take online classes full time so that she can monitor his schoolwork more carefully. In addition to opening a dance school  Ms. Rivera wants to start a business similar to her present workplace. While the family has learned to resolve problems  Ms. Rivera refuses to lower her expectations. She bristles when she hears her children or their friends say they cannot do something. “Don’t say  ‘I can’t ’” she said. “Joaquin never says  ‘I can’t ’ because he hears me. ” That is one way she lays the foundation for her children’s future. Ms. Rivera said Alyssa was struggling one day with homework. So she took time out of her own schoolwork  encouraged her daughter and patiently walked her through the steps of writing a   essay. “It took her three hours  and when she was done  I said "WASHINGTON  —   Congress opened for battle over the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday as Republicans pushed immediately forward to repeal the health care law and President Obama made a rare trip to Capitol Hill to defend it. The bitterness that has long marked the fight intensified as Republicans seized the opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise to get rid of the law  a pledge reinforced on Wednesday by Vice   Mike Pence  who met with House Republicans not far from where the president gathered with Democrats. The Affordable Care Act  Mr. Obama’s signature health care law  has created online insurance marketplaces  offered new protections to people seeking health insurance  and provided coverage to millions of people near the poverty line through expanded Medicaid. Health policy experts say that system could collapse if Republicans cut off funds for the expanded coverage and end penalties for people who go without health insurance. “The American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country ” Mr. Pence said  “and we are determined to give them that. ” He said that   Donald J. Trump would use his executive authority to help make the transition away from the health care law  but did not offer specifics. Democrats vowed aggressive resistance  however  and said they would not participate in drawing up a replacement for the law after the swift efforts to unravel it. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the new Democratic leader  playing off Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan  said repealing the law would “make America sick again. ” Republicans are using a procedural approach that will allow them to repeal substantial parts of the health care law without Democrats’ being able to mount a filibuster in the Senate. By a vote of 51 to 48 on Wednesday  the Senate took the first step  agreeing to take up a budget resolution  or blueprint  that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the  law. But even as Republicans spoke of moving quickly to repeal the law  it remained far less clear how and when they would go about replacing it. Senate debate on the budget resolution is expected to continue for several days  and the House plans to take up the measure once the Senate has approved it. As Republicans charged ahead  both sides seemed cognizant of the possible fallout from unwinding the law  which has become deeply enmeshed with America’s health care system and has provided insurance for about 20 million people. Mr. Trump weighed in with several Twitter posts. He advised that Republicans needed to “be careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster ” and added  “Don’t let the Schumer clowns out of this web. ” Mr. Trump predicted that the health care law would “fall of its own weight. ” Representative Chris Collins of New York  a Republican who is one of Mr. Trump’s top supporters in Congress and is part of his transition team  said it was important to be sure that Democrats bear responsibility for the failings of the health care law. Republicans point out that premiums have risen and that consumers in many places have fewer choices of insurers. “We have to make sure we keep reminding America  we are repealing it because it failed  we are repealing it because they all but demanded that we repeal it ” Mr. Collins said. “And that was a key piece of Donald Trump’s campaign. ” But as Republicans expressed eagerness to repeal the law  they acknowledged that replacing it would take more time. It is also unclear how insurance companies will react during this period and whether they will continue to offer the marketplace plans that millions of people have come to rely on. “There will naturally be a reasonable transition period ” said Senator Ted Cruz  Republican of Texas. “You can’t adopt new reforms all at once. ” Senator John Cornyn of Texas  the No. 2 Senate Republican  noted that it had taken six years to get into “the ditch we find ourselves in now. ” “When your truck or car is in a ditch  the first thing you need to do is get out of the ditch ” Mr. Cornyn said. “And sometimes that takes a lot of hard work. ” To that  Senator Debbie Stabenow  Democrat of Michigan  parried that when a car goes into a ditch  “the first thing I don’t do is dismantle the car. ” “That doesn’t help me get anywhere in terms of transportation ” she said. Democrats signaled little interest in helping Republicans determine what to do after repealing major parts of the health care law. Mr. Schumer predicted that in a year  Republicans would “regret that they came out so fast out of the box. ” He said Democrats would consider working on a replacement only after Republicans presented their own plan. “If you are repealing  show us what you’ll replace it with first ” Mr. Schumer said. “Then we’ll look at what you have and see what we can do. ” Later  Mr. Schumer said of Mr. Trump  “It’s his and their responsibility  plain and simple  —   name calling isn’t going to get anything done. ” He added  “They really need to calm things down a little. ” Speaker Paul D. Ryan tried to offer assurance that no change in coverage would be abrupt. “The point is  in 2017  we don’t want people to be caught with nothing ” he said. “We want to make sure that there’s an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief. ” Mr. Obama huddled with congressional Democrats for about 90 minutes in what was billed by the White House as a strategy session to forge a unified Democratic response to the Republicans’ rollback effort. In reality  the session was essentially a   party for a man who passed his signature legislative accomplishment under   majorities in Congress and a “pep rally” for Affordable Care Act defenders  in the words of an attendee  Representative Hank Johnson  Democrat of Georgia. The gathering  which could be Mr. Obama’s last trip to the halls of Congress that have been the site of alternating triumph and defeat  had a     air  with numerous Democratic lawmakers  including Mr. Johnson  sneaking out to attend to business more pressing than hearing the president’s words. Mr. Obama  for his part  did not ask his allies to block all efforts to alter the law  but warned Democrats against “rescuing” Republicans by defecting on votes that would dismantle it. The president provided an array of arguments for keeping the Affordable Care Act and offered a mild mea culpa for his shortcomings as a salesman over the years. Senator Jeff Merkley  Democrat of Oregon  said
