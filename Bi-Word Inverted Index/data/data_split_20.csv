12.0 "Just how   is Hillary Kerr  the    founder of a   digital media company in Los Angeles? She can tell you what song was playing five years ago on the jukebox at the bar where she somewhat randomly met the man who became her husband. It was “These Days ” the version sung by Nico  the German   made famous by Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground. Actually  the song had been playing just before she met Jonathan Leahy  now 38  on that December night in 2011 at the 4100 Bar in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles. Ms. Kerr can’t remember exactly what was playing when they met because at that moment she was jumping up and down “like Tigger ” as she put it. In answering the usual     questions  Mr. Leahy told her he was a music supervisor for “Girls ” the HBO show created by and starring Lena Dunham. That was enough to get Ms. Kerr bouncing. “Your music has changed my life!” she told Mr. Leahy. Mr. Leahy  who is quiet but not shy (at least he doesn’t jump up and down upon meeting people) was mesmerized. “My main reaction ” he said  “was it’s a lot easier to talk to beautiful women in a bar when you’re working on a hit show. ” They exchanged email addresses  more an act of politeness than promise. Then their soundtrack went quiet for almost a year. Both Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr had active social lives  but they were focused on their careers. Mr. Leahy  who grew up in Laconia  N. H. graduated from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg  Va. in 2000 and landed in Los Angeles later that year. Now he is a music supervisor with Aperture Music and is joined by Manish Raval and Tom Wolfe in being responsible for the music on “Girls. ” The team has also worked on films including “Trainwreck” and television series such as “New Girl. ” In addition  Mr. Leahy is the music supervisor for “Survivor’s Remorse” on Starz. Ms. Kerr grew up in the La Jolla section of San Diego  graduated from the University of Southern California in 2000 and eventually made her way to New York  where she took a job as an assistant at Elle magazine. In 2005 she moved back to the West Coast  to Los Angeles  and with a fellow Elle alum   Katherine Power  created a company best known for its website  Who What Wear  which casts an eye on celebrity culture and fashion it now has 13 million monthly unique visitors. Ms. Kerr and Ms. Power also started the Who What Wear clothing and accessories line sold at Target. It was nine months after their initial meeting that Mr. Leahy emailed Ms. Kerr. He had a friend who wanted to get into the fashion industry. Ms. Kerr  Mr. Leahy and his friend met for a long  boozy brunch. They began to email and text a bit. “There was banter ” Ms. Kerr said  but neither knew the interest or intention of the other. A few months later  she texted to ask if he could help her score a ticket to see the band Lord Huron. Mr. Leahy happens to be a friend of Ben Schneider  the band’s lead singer  and had an extra ticket. “This was one of those moments where the universe conspires to make you seem cooler than you actually are ” Mr. Leahy said. He and Ms. Kerr met up at the show. That is when Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr moved into the ambiguous “mixtape era ” in which for months they emailed and texted each other with coy “are we just friends or what” texts revolving around music. For example  Ms. Kerr was visiting New York and texted Mr. Leahy a request for “walking around SoHo music. ” He sent her a link to “Love Me Again ” by John Newman. It has a club vibe but romantic lyrics. “I wanted to read into it ” Ms. Kerr said  but she figured (correctly  it turns out) that her new friend was a bit of a clueless guy who didn’t spend much time thinking about how a woman might react to such a song being shared with her. Another time he emailed her a link to a Fleetwood Mac version of “Need Your Love So Bad. ” After listening to it  Ms. Kerr said  “I called my friend Katie. ” “At that time ” she continued  “I just referred to him as ‘the supervisor.’ She knew I had a crush on him. She said  ‘How can it not mean something? ’” Mr. Leahy acknowledged that it might be difficult for a person to think he was not sending Ms. Kerr a message with this song. “I sort of thought  ‘Maybe it’s too much. ’” But he shared it with her anyway. (This is the same man who sent her the song “BedBedBedBedBed  Vacationer Remix ” by Deleted Scenes  “during the friend phase ” Ms. Kerr said.) Ms. Kerr played the game  too. She made Mr. Leahy a mix CD (handwritten liner notes and all) that she titled “Feynman Diagrams for All ” after Mr. Leahy told her in a text conversation that he thought the idea of Feynman diagrams  —   in which physicists map out the interactions of subatomic particles  —   was romantic. On the mix  Ms. Kerr included the Mazzy Star song “I’ve Been Let Down. ” It was “a bit of an Easter egg of my actual feelings ” she said. Around this time  Ms. Kerr texted Mr. Leahy a photo of the drink menu from a bar   the Roger Room. She had focused on a drink named for the song “Christmas Card From a Hooker in Minneapolis ” which happens to be Mr. Leahy’s favorite Tom Waits tune. “This made me rethink things a bit ” he said  adding  “Hillary Kerr was clearly not to be trifled with. ” In early 2014  Mr. Leahy invited her to a Bleachers concert. The band’s lead singer is Jack Antonoff  who is Ms. Dunham’s boyfriend. Ms. Dunham was at the concert as well  and on meeting Ms. Kerr  she said  “I’ve heard so much about you. ” Ms. Kerr and Mr. Leahy shared their first kiss that night. He proposed to her on Polihale Beach in Kauai  Hawaii  on Jan. 1  2016. On Dec. 10  125 friends and relatives gathered in Palm Springs  Calif. at the Colony Palms Hotel  which was opened in 1936 by the reputed mobster Al Wertheimer and whose poolside guests have included Frank Sinatra  Ronald Reagan  Kirk Douglas and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Ms. Kerr walked down a grassy aisle in a   courtyard wearing a structured lace Reem Acra dress  strapless with a bustier and a full skirt. Four musicians played “Once  With Feeling ” an instrumental song Mr. Leahy wrote for Ms. Kerr. . Just minutes into the cocktail reception  a few of Ms. Kerr’s best friends descended upon her. Jen Atkin  the celebrity hairstylist and social media star  started fussing with the flower she had sewn into the bride’s hair. Joey Maalouf  the celebrity makeup artist who is a creator of the       service the Glam App  whipped out a tube of lip gloss and reapplied it to the bride’s pucker. He had done her makeup. “The look we went for is sickeningly stunning and perfect ” he said. Guests mingled over drinks by the pool  which was framed by banquette tables lit from above by strings of bulbs. The sky turned pink before the stars appeared  and guests snapped photos and shared them with the hundreds of thousands who follow these members of the   illuminati (#imwithkerr and #letsgetleahyed). “This looks like it’s art directed ” Eva Chen  the head of fashion partnerships for Instagram  said as she took it all in. She had worked as an assistant at Elle with Ms. Kerr. Friends of both the bride and the groom celebrated what they saw as a great match  based on passion not only for each other but also for music. Leigh Belz Ray  the features and news director at InStyle  was another former Elle colleague who made the trip. “Hillary loves music  and it’s not just a casual thing ” Ms. Ray said. “We used to say the ultimate fantasy was to become a music director  and now she’s married to one. ” After a romantic first dance to Solomon Burke’s “If You Need Me ” Mr. and Mrs. Leahy (she will use her maiden name professionally) settled into several hours of serious dancing to songs spun by a D. J. And before they left for their Hawaiian honeymoon  Mr. Leahy completed his first important act as husband. He pulled together many of the songs that could be considered the soundtrack to their romance and made his wife a mixtape. When Dec. 10  2016 Where Colony Palms Hotel  Palm Springs  Calif. Flora The bride and groom were married under a white birch trellis  because white birch is the state tree of New Hampshire  where Mr. Leahy grew up and where his parents  Richard and Marie Leahy  reside. The structure was wrapped in white peonies  Sahara roses and camellia greens. Readings Mr. Leahy’s family is Roman Catholic Ms. Kerr’s parents  John and Carole Kerr  are more spiritual than religiously observant. Many of the guests had an artistic bent. The bride and groom planned accordingly. Marshall Goldsmith  an executive coach  author and lifelong family friend of Ms. Kerr  officiated. Friends and relatives stood to read poems from James Kavanaugh and Mary Oliver  as well as a passage from the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling legalizing   marriage. “A little Catholic priest  a little lesbian Pulitzer Prize winner  a little equal rights for all "Angels are everywhere in the Muñiz family’s apartment in the Bronx: paintings of angels on the wall  ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR  angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves. As José and Zoraida Muñiz and their children have struggled to deal with a   series of trials and setbacks  including cancer  debilitating epilepsy  deep depression and near eviction  it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together. Zoraida’s early life in Puerto Rico was like something from a tropical Dickens novel. She and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the children’s father withdrew support. Then Zoraida’s grandfather  —   the father of her absent father  —   destroyed the house in a rage. She was barely a teenager when she met José  a Vietnam War veteran. With permission from her uncle  a judge  they were married. She was 14. He was 29. They moved to New York in 1983 and started a new life. He built boilers. She worked in construction  using skills she learned as a child  and in a clothing store. But in 1987  Mr. Muñiz began having violent seizures  —   eight or 10 a day. They did not respond to medication. He could no longer work. She stopped working to take care of him. Still determined to live something like a normal life  they started a family. Their first child  José Jr. had a heart defect. By the time he was 2 he had had six   operations. That’s where the angels came in  —   the first one was a painting  a gift from a cousin.  “When they operated on my son  they told me he was an angel  because he was supposed to die ” Ms. Muñiz  50  said. “From there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family. ” All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives  or picked up off the street  just like all the furniture in the Muñizes’ overstuffed apartment in a   complex on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx  much of it restored by Ms. Muñiz. “So many people throw away things  so I don’t have to buy ” she said. A second son  Jesus  became epileptic at 3. A girl  Maria  completed the family. In 2007  Mr. Muñiz had what felt like a horrible  stubborn toothache. It turned out to be cancer of the lower jaw. Ms. Muñiz stayed in the room with her husband while he received radiation treatment. “I’m willing to take anything with him ” she said. “I never left him alone  and I never will. ” Radiation did not work. To save Mr. Muñiz’s life  surgeons removed his tongue and his lower jaw and cut a hole through his esophagus. Disfigured  depressed and unable to speak  he can consume nothing thicker than milk and needs   care. This is the household where the Muñiz children grew up. “We’ve been through every craziness ” said José Jr. 24  who has suffered depression so severe that he dropped out of college and confined himself to the apartment  “every up and down. ” For years at a time  the family held on  seemingly by a thread. Over the summer  the younger son  Jesus  22  got a   job at a Zaro’s Bakery in Manhattan’s financial district. Because the family’s rent is tied to income  the rent tripled in August  to about $770 a month from $245. But Jesus had school bills to pay  and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for José Sr. ’s mother  who died over the summer  and things began to unravel. They fell behind on the rent and utilities. Food was often scarce. The family regularly skipped meals. It was around this time that Ms. Muñiz got in touch with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York  one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund. It covered their back rent  got them warm coats and blankets and helped them apply for food stamps for the first time. And with $600 from the Neediest Cases Fund  the family paid its electric bill. Things are looking up in some ways. Jesus is returning to college  where he is on a   track and wants to be a paramedic. Maria graduated in December from a   nursing program. Thinking of her father and his illness  she wants to be an oncologist. José Jr. was just accepted to the New York Film Academy’s photography program. But José Sr. continues to battle cancer. Zoraida is severely depressed. What keeps her going? she was asked. She gestured toward her family  sitting beside her beneath the painted angels. “They give me my strength  even if I have times I collapse ” she said. José Jr. agreed. “I use my parents and siblings as my motivation ” he said. “We’re all there for each other "With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House  it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry. After all  Mr. Trump has mocked the science of global warming as a Chinese hoax  threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory. So consider what happened in the middle of December  after investors had had a month to absorb the implications of Mr. Trump’s victory. The federal government opened bidding on a tract of the ocean floor off New York State as a potential site for a huge wind farm. Up  up and away soared the offers  —   interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day. In the end  the winning bidder offered the federal Treasury $42 million  more than twice what the government got in August for oil leases  —   oil leases  —   in the Gulf of Mexico. Who won the bid? None other than Statoil  the Norwegian oil company  which is in the midst of a major campaign to turn itself into a big player in renewable energy. We do not know for sure that the New York wind farm will get built  but we do know this: The energy transition is real  and Mr. Trump is not going to stop it. On a global scale  more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy. That is more than $300 billion a year  a sign of how powerful the momentum has become. Wind power is booming in the United States  with the industry adding manufacturing jobs in the reddest states. When Mr. Trump’s appointees examine the facts  they will learn that   technician is projected to be the   occupation in America over the next decade. The election of Mr. Trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair. They had pinned their hopes on a Hillary Clinton victory and a continuation of President Obama’s strong push to tackle global warming. Now  of course  everything is in flux. In the worst case  with a sufficiently pliant Congress  Mr. Trump could roll back a decade of progress on climate change. Barring some miraculous conversion on Mr. Trump’s part  his election cannot be interpreted as anything but bad news for the climate agenda. Yet despair might be an overreaction. For starters  when Mr. Trump gets to the White House  he will find that the federal government actually has relatively little control over American energy policy  and particularly over electricity generation. The coal industry has been ravaged in part by cheap natural gas  which is abundant because of technological changes in the way it is produced  and there is no lever in the Oval Office that Mr. Trump can pull to reverse that. The intrinsically weak federal role was a source of frustration for Mr. Obama and his aides  but now it will work to the benefit of environmental advocates. They have already persuaded more than half the states to adopt mandates on renewable energy. Efforts to roll those back have largely failed  with the latest development coming only last week  when Gov. John Kasich of Ohio  a Republican  vetoed a rollback bill. The federal government does offer important subsidies for renewable energy  and they will surely become a target in the new Congress. But those subsidies are already scheduled to fall drastically over five years  in a deal cut a year ago that gave the oil industry some favors and that passed Congress with many Republican votes. If Mr. Trump pushes for an early end to the subsidies  he will find that renewable energy has friends in the Republican Party. Topping that list is Charles E. Grassley  the senior senator from Iowa. That state  —     in presidential politics  let us remember  —   will soon be getting 40 percent of its electricity from wind power. “Senator Grassley has been and continues to be an extraordinary leader and champion for the wind industry ” said Tom Kiernan  the head of the American Wind Energy Association  a trade group. When I spoke with him last week  Mr. Kiernan did not sound like a man gnashing his teeth about the impending Trump era. By his group’s calculations  $80 billion of wind industry investment is in the pipeline for the United States over the next few years. “We are creating jobs throughout America    jobs  and we think   Trump will want that to continue ” he said. If Mr. Trump really wanted to roll back the clock  he could try to get Congress to override all the state mandates  a gross violation of the supposed conservative commitment to federalism. But it would be a titanic fight  some Republican senators would defect on principle  and Mr. Trump would almost certainly lose. So if the damage Mr. Trump can do domestically is limited by circumstance  what about the international effort against global warming? That is the prospect that has David G. Victor most worried. Dr. Victor  a professor at the University of California at San Diego  is one of the closest observers of global climate politics. While the nations of the world agreed a year ago to a landmark deal to tackle global warming  that consensus is fragile  he pointed out. The Paris Agreement is really an outline more promise than reality. Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw. Right now  other countries are saying they will go forward even if he does so  but it is not hard to imagine the thing unraveling. As part of the negotiations  the Obama administration promised billions of dollars from American taxpayers to help poor countries adjust to the devastation of global warming. “That’s a big part of the glue that held the Paris deal together ” Dr. Victor pointed out. Mr. Trump is considered likely to abandon that pledge. Perhaps the biggest threat to the climate agenda posed by the incoming administration is not anything that Mr. Trump might do  but rather what he will not do. While the energy transition is real  it is still in its earliest stages. Iowa may soon get 40 percent of its power from wind  but for the United States as a whole  the figure is closer to 5 percent. The transition is simply not happening fast enough. The pledges countries made in Paris  even if kept  are not ambitious enough. To meet the climate goals embodied in the Paris Agreement  the world needed an American president who would have pushed hard to accelerate the energy transition. You can debate whether Mrs. Clinton would have been that president  but it is certainly clear that Mr. Trump will not be. So as Washington goes into reverse gear on climate policy  seas will keep rising and heat waves will get worse. Later this month  global monitoring agencies are expected to report that 2016 was the hottest year in the historical record  beating out 2015  which beat out 2014. If nothing else "THOMPSONS  Tex.  —   Can one of the most promising  —   and troubled  —   technologies for fighting global warming survive during the administration of Donald J. Trump? The technology  carbon capture  involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the   gas can make its way into the atmosphere. Mr. Trump’s denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change  a view shared by many of his cabinet nominees  might appear to doom any such environmental initiatives. But the new Petra Nova plant about to start running here  about 30 miles southwest of Houston  is a bright spot for the technology’s supporters. It is being completed essentially on time and within its budget  unlike many previous such projects. When it fires up  the plant  which is attached to one of the power company NRG’s hulking   units  will draw 90 percent of the CO2 from the emissions produced by 240 megawatts of generated power. That is a fraction of the roughly 3  700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant  the largest in the Lone Star State. Still  it is enough to capture 1. 6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year  —   equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3. 5 billion miles  or the CO2 from generating electricity for 214  338 homes. From a tower hundreds of feet above the Petra Nova operation  the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an Erector set fanatic  with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plant’s skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors. Petra Nova uses the most common technology for carbon capture. The exhaust stream  pushed down a snaking conduit to the Petra Nova equipment  is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines  which bond with the carbon dioxide. That solution is pumped to a regenerator  or stripper  which heats the amine and releases the CO2. The gas is drawn off and compressed for further use  and the amine solution is then cycled back through the system to absorb more CO2. Petra Nova  a   joint venture of NRG and JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration  will not just grab the CO2  it will use it  pushing compressed CO2 through a new pipeline 81 miles to an oil field. The gas will be injected into wells  a technique known as enhanced oil recovery  that should increase production to 15  000 barrels a day from about 300 barrels a day. And since NRG owns a quarter of the oil recovery project  what comes out of the ground will help pay for the carbon capture operation. The plant  which has received $190 million from the federal government  can be economically viable if the price of oil is about $50 a barrel  said David Knox  an NRG spokesman. The company expects to declare the plant operational in January  Mr. Knox said. Aware of problems with carbon capture projects around the country and of the risks of hubris  he said: “We’re not going to declare victory before it’s time. ” If the price of oil stabilizes or rises  and if tax breaks for developing the technology continue and markets for carbon storage develop  he said  utilities might ask  “why would I not want to put a carbon capture system on my plant?” But developing   carbon capture has been neither straightforward nor easy. So far  problems have bedeviled major projects  often costing far more than projected and taking longer to complete. The federal government has canceled projects like Future Gen  which was granted more than $1 billion by the Obama administration. Carbon capture systems are not just expensive to build they tend to be   and make the plant less efficient over all  —   a problem known as “parasitic load. ” The Petra Nova carbon capture process gets its energy from a separate power plant constructed for the purpose  which NRG says makes the system more efficient than it would otherwise be  and frees up all of the capacity of the main power plant to sell all of the electricity it produces. The company estimates that the next plant it builds could cost 20 percent less  thanks to lessons learned this time around. If Petra Nova succeeds  it means a boost for carbon capture. Despite carbon capture’s problems  its supporters  including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency  call the technology  known as carbon capture sequestration  crucial for meeting emissions standards that can prevent the worst effects of climate change. “If you don’t have C. C. S. the chance of success goes down  and the cost of success goes up ” said Julio Friedmann  an expert at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California and a former Energy Department official. “If you do have C. C. S. the chance of success goes up and the cost of success goes down. ” Carbon capture is proving itself  said David Mohler  the deputy assistant secretary for clean coal and carbon management at the federal Energy Department. Developing technologies often involves delay and cost overruns initially  he said. “You cannot engineer all the bugs out from inside a cubicle  —   you really have to do this stuff in the real world ” he said. Driving down costs  he noted  is what engineers and businesses do through research  development and production. He cited the plummeting cost of initially expensive technologies like solar power. “We do figure things out as we go ” he said. What the Trump administration will do with carbon capture is  at this point  anyone’s guess. “The technology only makes sense in a world where you are seeking to avoid putting CO2 into the atmosphere ” said Mark Brownstein  a vice president for the climate and energy program at the Environmental Defense Fund. But some supporters of the technology see reasons for hope. “I actually think it’s a moment of optimism ” said Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota  who met with Mr. Trump last month as a potential agriculture secretary. Ms. Heitkamp   legislation  with another Democrat  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island  to expand and extend tax breaks for carbon capture projects. “What I saw with the   was a laserlike focus on jobs ” she said. “I think he was intrigued” about the economic opportunity that carbon capture could provide to keep coal power generation in the national mix  she added. One of the pillars of Mr. Trump’s campaign was his intention to revive the fortunes of the coal industry through support of   clean coal. And while the exact meaning of the   phrase is open to interpretation  it generally includes not just technologies that remove soot and   pollutants  but also carbon dioxide. Ms. Heitkamp said that businesses  too  were likely to continue development of carbon capture technology  since they planned their plant investments on a curve of decades and are loath to change course because of a single election. “The decision they are making is not  what does the political outlook look like today? What’s it look like over the life of this plant?” Although she concedes that a   revival of coal’s fortunes is unlikely  carbon capture could be a way to extend the life of current facilities while keeping the nation’s energy mix diverse. Jeff Erikson  general manager at the Global C. C. S. Institute  which promotes the technology  said he did not expect to see a great number of new coal plants on the way. “I wouldn’t say carbon capture is going to rescue the coal industry ” he said  but pointed out that there is great potential for applying carbon capture to diverse natural gas plants and to industrial applications. Captured carbon can be used not just for oil production but a widening range of industrial processes  or can even be pumped into the ground. One of the most innovative approaches to carbon capture is being tried 50 miles east of the Petra Nova plant  in La Porte  Tex. where a consortium of companies is trying an entirely new approach to   power generation. In a $140 million  50 megawatt demonstration project  the company  Net Power  will use superheated carbon dioxide in much the same way that conventional power plants use steam to drive turbines. This system  invented by a British engineer  Rodney Allam  eliminates the inefficiency inherent in heating water into steam and cooling it again. The power plant produces a stream of very pure  pressurized carbon dioxide that is ready for pipelines without much of the additional processing that conventional carbon capture systems require. The creators say that their technology will produce electric power at a price comparable to   power plants  the efficient   plants that burn gas to power one turbine and then use the excess heat from that process to generate additional power with a steam turbine. That means  in effect  that “the cost of being green is zero ” said Bill Brown  the chief executive of Net Power. “The potential to capture CO2 at no additional cost would be a game changer ” said Fatima Maria Ahmad  a fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions  a think tank. Net Power combines the resources of Exelon Generation  a power company  the engineering and construction firm CBI  and 8 Rivers Capital  which developed the technology used in the project. The centerpiece of the project is a special turbine built by Toshiba and designed for the punishingly high pressure used in the process. And while any system that so closely resembles a rocket engine has the potential for what engineers delicately refer to as a RUD  —   “rapid unplanned disassembly”  —   those working directly on the project say they have designed safety features that give them confidence. Even if the United States government shows little interest in reducing the nation’s carbon footprint under Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress  consortium officials say they expect to find ready customers from companies in the United States and around the globe  where the threat of climate change is fully acknowledged. “We see this very much playing into all parts of the world ” said Daniel McCarthy  executive vice president for CBI’s technology operating group. Environmentalists remain divided on the issue of carbon capture  said John Coequyt  global climate policy director for Sierra Club. “This is the issue where the biggest range of positions exists within the environmental community ” he said. Groups like the Clean Air Task Force favor it strongly. Other factions call clean coal a fig leaf to keep coal  with all of its environmental baggage  in the energy mix. And many suggest the billions of dollars spent on trying to capture carbon would be better directed to the technologies that don’t pollute the atmosphere in the first place. Dr. Friedmann  the former energy official  predicted that the technology would prove its usefulness. “It’s convenient to just say ‘Keep it in the ground ’ ” he said 1.0 "WEST PALM BEACH  Fla.  —   When   Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend  he did it in   opulence  joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone  the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. Trump’s    resort in Palm Beach. President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford  Tex. His father had a compound in Kennebunkport  Me. President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii  staying at a private home. But Mr. Trump’s   private club in Florida  where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City  is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th president’s winter White House. And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post  the cereal heiress and the property’s original owner  who left    to the federal government when she died in 1973  hoping it would serve as a home for presidents. But the government had no interest in her plan  and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $10 million  turning it into a club where membership costs six figures. Mr. Trump’s arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite  and he opened up   ’s membership to Jews and   who had been excluded from other   establishments. He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple. Since Mr. Trump’s victory in November     has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club: the chance to rub shoulders with the next president. “It’s like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long ” said Jeff Greene  a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010  who is a    member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter. Instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan  Mr. Trump has been seated at an ornately designed couch  upholstered in pale fabric laced with gold  beneath a chandelier hanging from the ceiling  a scene resembling a mansion in “Sunset Boulevard” or “Citizen Kane ” two of Mr. Trump’s favorite movies. At night  the couches are moved out and tables are added to accommodate the evening cocktail crowd  among whom Mr. Trump moves from one table to the next  the most powerful greeter in the world. At the annual New Year’s Eve party on Saturday night  a   white menu included “Mr. Trump’s wedge salad ” a wild mushroom and Swiss chard ravioli and a “breakfast buffet. ” Those in attendance drifted in under a    striped awning  the men dressed in tuxedos  the women in ball gowns  many with their hair swept high. Guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party. Mr. Trump later delivered remarks  according to a guest  who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years. Howie Carr  a conservative radio host who was supportive of Mr. Trump  roamed the crowd  with Mr. Carr posting on Twitter that his daughter asked Mr. Trump if she could be an intern in the White House. Mr. Trump’s two adult sons  Eric and Donald Jr. posed for photographs. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” were also there. Like most aspects of Mr. Trump’s business interests  the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than $500. Mr. Trump’s aides rejected the questions. Mr. Trump returned to New York on Sunday night. But the club will remain an escape for him. His contentious Twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at    compared with when he is isolated inside Trump Tower. Mr. Trump’s combative public persona  —   often on display during his campaign  —   mostly dissolves behind the   walls of his castle. “   is an environment he can control ” said the historian Douglas Brinkley  who last week attended a    lunch with a longtime club member  Chris Ruddy  the chief executive of Newsmax Media. “I watched him hold court  —   he was so comfortable in his own skin  and so relaxed. ” Mr. Ruddy has hosted Mr. Carr and Laura Ingraham  another conservative radio host who supported Mr. Trump  at the club and has introduced Mr. Trump to a range of news media figures  politicians and donors. He described the   as “seeking the   Donald Trump: totally at ease  very positive  very gregarious. ” Mr. Trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club. Over the Thanksgiving holiday  he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint Rudolph W. Giuliani or Mitt Romney as his secretary of state (he ended up picking neither). During this trip  he has heaped praise on his ultimate choice for the job  Rex W. Tillerson  the head of Exxon Mobil. (Mr. Trump has called him “Mr. Exxon. ”) He talks about the work he has done to find a solution for the problems at the Department of Veteran Affairs  which included a recent meeting with a number of executives at   . Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that he intended to make Brian Burns  the businessman son of a confidante of Joseph P. Kennedy  the ambassador to Ireland. Isaac Perlmutter  the reclusive head of Marvel Entertainment  is a    member who helped Mr. Trump put that meeting together. Mr. Trump has also held   with Robert K. Kraft  the owner of the New England Patriots and a club member  and hosted prominent figures like Carlos Slim  the billionaire who is Mexico’s richest man. Mr. Trump his wife  Melania and their    son  Barron  inhabit a residential area of the club. His adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property. Mr. Trump frequently dines on the patio  a central point of action  where at night a singer plays with a small band  sometimes belting out requests from Mr. Trump and other guests. (“My Way ” a song popularized by Frank Sinatra  was one recent choice.) A violinist sometimes moves among tables  plucking tunes like the theme from “Fiddler on the Roof. ” Mr. Trump has given the cadre of White House reporters who now cover him some access to the club  but grudgingly so  —   he once again eluded the reporters covering him on Saturday  slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in Jupiter. And outside the confines of    old grievances flare up. On the golf course  Mr. Trump spotted Harry Hurt  a biographer who wrote critically of Mr. Trump years ago  preparing to play a round with David H. Koch  a billionaire conservative donor. Mr. Trump ordered club officials to remove Mr. Hurt from the property  according to a Facebook post by Mr. Hurt. Over the years  Mr. Trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with Palm Beach officials. He has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over    and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds. With its owner’s coming new job  the club has had some changes. Guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance. Secret Service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property  at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds. Robin Bernstein  a club member for nearly 25 years  said that some club members might express frustration  but that most thought it was important “that we keep Donald and his family safe. ” Attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the   around  and expect it will continue. “The loser in this game is Camp David ” said Mr. Brinkley "This article is part of a series aimed at helping you navigate life’s opportunities and challenges. What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes. com. When you woke up this morning  what did you do first? Did you hop in the shower  check your email or grab a doughnut? What did you say to your roommates on the way out the door? Salad or hamburger for lunch? When you got home  did you put on your sneakers and go for a run  or eat dinner in front of the television? Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of   decision making  but they’re not. They’re habits. And though each habit means relatively little on its own  over time  the meals we eat  how we spend our evenings  and how often we exercise have enormous impacts. This is particularly true in our 20s  when so many of our habits are still up for grabs. The patterns you establish right now will impact your health  productivity  financial security and happiness for decades. How much money you make  how much time you spend with your friends and family  how well your body functions years from now  —   all of these  in many ways  are products of the habits you are building today. (Related: The 8 health habits experts say you need in your 20s) And in the last decade  our understanding of the neurology of habit formation has been transformed. We’ve learned how habits form  —   and why they are so hard to break. We now know how to create good habits and change bad ones like never before. At the core of every habit is a neurological loop with three parts: A cue  a routine and a reward. To understand how to create habits  —   such as exercise habits  —   you must learn to establish the right cues and rewards. In 2002  researchers at New Mexico State University studied 266 individuals  most of whom worked out at least three times a week. They found that many of them had started running or lifting weights almost on a whim  or because they suddenly had free time or wanted to deal with unexpected stresses in their lives. However  the reason they continued exercising  —   why it became a habit  —   was because of a specific cue and a specific reward. If you want to start running each morning  it’s essential that you choose a simple cue (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or always going for a run at the same time of day) and a clear reward (like a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles  or the endorphin rush you get from a jog). But countless studies have shown that  at first  the rewards inherent in exercise aren’t enough. So to teach your brain to associate exercise with a reward  you need to give yourself something you really enjoy  —   like a small piece of chocolate  —   after your workout. This is counterintuitive  because most people start exercising to lose weight. But the goal here is to train your brain to associate a certain cue (“It’s 5 o’clock”) with a routine (“Three miles down! ”) and a reward (“Chocolate! ”). Eventually  your brain will start expecting the reward inherent in exercise (“It’s 5 o’clock. Three miles down! Endorphin rush! ”) and you won’t need the chocolate anymore. In fact  you won’t even want it. But until your neurology learns to enjoy those endorphins and the other rewards inherent in exercise  you need to   the process. And then  over time  it will become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. You won’t want the chocolate anymore. You’ll just crave the endorphins. The cue  in addition to triggering a routine "It’s the season for family travel and photos  —   and perhaps enlarging some of those images of snowy landscapes or tropical getaways to decorate your home. There are  of course  the usual print services and methods. You can choose a glossy or matte finish  print a photo on canvas  or make it into a poster with a few clicks online at photo sites like Snapfish and Shutterfly  professional photo shops like Adorama and Mpix  or drugstores and   chains like Walgreens and Costco. But the web is also home to many   printing services  as well as uncommon surfaces on which to enlarge photos for display  be it burlap  wood boards  acrylic or    fabric. Why not try some fresh sites and methods? I recently sent some   quality iPhone vacation photos to a handful of companies that I’d never used before and had them enlarged to various sizes and printed on different surfaces. I’ve also offered some guidance about bulk digitizing those boxes of old travel photos sitting in your closet or basement so that you can begin the New Year if not with a vacation  then with a   home. Of all the ways to turn photos into wall art  I was most interested in trying engineer prints  named for the large  lightweight prints used by architects. For less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets  you can make huge enlargements. Mind you  it’s a particular aesthetic  one that’s most likely to appeal to people who are after an industrial  shabby chic or bohemian look. The paper is thin and the lines of the images are softer than a fine art print. And engineer prints need not be formally framed. People stick them to their walls with washi tape  a crafting tape that comes in innumerable colors and prints or they hang the prints using wood poster rails or skeleton clips. For a while  engineer prints from photos were primarily available in black and white  but now you can find them in color  too. One of the easiest ways to order them online is through Parabo Press  which is run by Photojojo  an online photography gear shop  and Zoomin  a photo printing service in Asia. As with all printing sites  you upload your image  zoom in closer if you like  and then click to buy. The site’s engineer prints are 4 feet by 3 feet  and cost $20 in black and white  and $25 in color. I sent out two different photos to be made in black and white  and they came out  to my surprise  beautifully. I was impressed that they were able to be enlarged to such a degree and not look blurry. And the paper (while so thin I was worried about accidentally tearing it) lends it an artful  careless look rather than the expected framed print over the couch. Parabo Press is a breeze to use: It’s clean and easy to read  your options are straightforward  and there are no annoying upsells. The site also offers prints on metal  glass  newsprint and Zines (handmade magazines) calendars photo books and prints from its Risograph machine  which uses   ink and is described by Parabo as having “a cult following since its invention in 1980s Japan. ” A fabric print  —   not soft like a bedsheet  more like a place mat made of matte woven fabric  —   is another departure from a traditional photo enlargement. Order one from a site such as SnapBox and instead of framing it  you can peel and stick it on your wall. The site’s fabric posters adhere to (and can be peeled off) smooth surfaces such as untextured walls  glass  ceilings  tile and finished wood surfaces (avoid surfaces like stucco  concrete blocks  brick  unfinished wood  canvas or freshly painted walls). SnapBox offers fabric posters in more than a dozen sizes from 4x4 to 36x54  from less than $2 to about $80. I ordered a 24x36 fabric poster for $34. 99  a discounted price thanks to a holiday coupon  —   not cheap (you can buy fine art prints on other sites for less) but you’re printing on special material. Regardless of the cost  I expected the finished product to look like the sort of cheap thing one might see in a dorm room (it sticks to walls  after all) but I was pleasantly surprised. The fabric was durable and the details in the photo  —   crevasses in a glacier onlookers on a bridge  —   were nicely defined. SnapBox is a   site with clear instructions and pricing. In addition to fabric posters  it also offers fine art prints  photo books and prints on canvas and pillows. While many places can print photos on hard surfaces such as metal and acrylic  printing on wood boards is less common. The grain shows through your photos  which  thematically speaking  seems to make sense for certain subjects  like nature photos taken at  say  the beach or in a park. But what would something more modern  like a skyscraper or a tower  look like on wood? I decided to give it a try and put an image of Tokyo Tower on an 8x12 board ($65). I sent the photo to PhotoBarn  a family business that makes its products by hand in a “ ” in Tennessee. The result was a lovely departure from framed prints and from canvas  which can sometimes make striking photos look like amateur paintings. The wood was smooth and thick  and the image was crisp with a slight sheen  —   a perfect complement to the steel of Tokyo tower and the silver and glass of surrounding skyscrapers. For the most part the site is intuitive  though a few too many holiday sale buttons on the home page made for a disorienting start. PhotoBarn will also print your photos on canvas  burlap  and other wood products  like ornaments. I noticed a number of complaints about PhotoBarn on Yelp and the Better Business Bureau website regarding shipping speeds and customer service. I didn’t have a problem  but if time is of the essence  you may want to check with the company before placing an order. Once you’ve turned the best of your travel photos into art  it’s time to store the rest. If boxes of prints are taking up closet (and psychic) space  there are plenty of sites online that will scan your old photos (as well as negatives  slides and videos) so you can store them digitally. But there are several things to keep in mind. In general  these sites are a pain to navigate. They’re cluttered with too much text and fine print  and they offer so many options  —   Do you want your photos scanned in order? Do you want both sides of the photo scanned?  —   that if you don’t have a goal in mind before you go in  you can quickly be overwhelmed. Decide ahead of time what exactly you want to scan  how many photos you have and how you might use whatever you scan. Also  note that some of these companies by default send DVDs or CDs of your digital files. Not everyone has a CD or DVD player. If you want a thumb drive instead  be sure to select that option (if it’s offered) or call the company and see if it will provide one. Be aware  too  that it’s not unusual for these companies to have long lead times. A number of them digitize your photos in other countries  so it can take weeks to get your images back. For affordable bulk scans  ScanMyPhotos. com is an old standby (you can read David Pogue’s review on nytimes. com). The company will scan about 1  800 photos at 300 dpi for $145 at its headquarters in Irvine  Calif. the cost of sending the photo box to you  as well as the shipping of the box to ScanMyPhotos and back to you again is included in the price. That’s one of the least costly and most uncomplicated deals around. Other companies charge for shipping photo boxes. I asked a photo editor at The Times if 300 dpi is sufficient for scanning and she said that to print photos at larger sizes  a higher dpi is preferable. ScanMyPhotos has such an option: a prepaid box for $259 for the same number of scans at 600 dpi instead of 300 dpi. A thumb drive is an additional $15. 95 a box. To find the best   place to scan photos and film  the Wirecutter  a consumer review site owned by The New York Times  researched 37 different scanning services and tested the top 12 contenders. Memories Renewed took the number one spot. The company  based in Minneapolis  Minn. offered “the best combination of price  quality  and turnaround time of any service we tested ” Wirecutter said. I was planning to try the service however  according to the Memories Renewed site  demand is so high at the moment that the lead time for most projects is more than two months. Scanning photos of any size up to 8. 5x11 is 60 cents a photo a thumb drive is $10 for 8 GB or $15 for 16 GB. Let’s say you don’t want to ship your irreplaceable photos in the mail. Or maybe you’d rather that strangers not see your photos and home videos. You could buy a scanner and scan your photos yourself  perhaps doing a batch for half an hour each day. Personally  I don’t want machines around my home collecting dust (and fast becoming outdated). So I decided to try the new PhotoScan app by Google Photos. It’s free and enables users to scan prints with a smartphone. First things first: These are not   scans. If you have prized photos in need of restoration  then go with a professional. However if  like me  you have a bunch of travel photos  —   landscapes  food  monuments  —   that you’re keeping simply because you want to remember where you were when  you may want to consider trying the app instead of giving up some privacy and spending upward of $150. By and large  PhotoScan is simple and quick  with almost no learning curve. If you try it  just make sure to hold your phone level when asked to move it over the image. Remember these words: Don’t tilt your phone! Most of the scans I made looked as good as the prints in terms of color and clarity. That said  this is unlikely to be your solution if you want   prints or have thousands of photos to scan. Once you get the hang of PhotoScan  using it becomes a repetitive  vaguely   activity. That is  unless the app crashes  which it did several times. But I was still glad for it. Even when it crashed 1.0 "Finally. The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday  with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making. They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn. They cheered. Their eyes filled with tears. They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations. It was the first day of 2017  and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line. In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers  they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes  taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations. “I was very choked up ” Betsy Morris  70  said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station  at noon. “How do you explain something that you never thought would happen? It’s going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes. ” It was a major moment for New York’s sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach. The opening of the first segment of the line  —   an extension of the Q train to 96th Street  —   promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4  5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue  the nation’s most overcrowded subway line  which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. When the stations opened shortly before noon  they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old  and strollers  suitcases and dogs  —   all familiar sights across the system. But for all the excitement  the line  with just three new stops  is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned. It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city  which has more than eight and a half million people and many   and minority residents who live far from a subway line. With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948  much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays  even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in March. Still  there was reason to cheer. The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nation’s infrastructure  from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems. Few new subway stations have opened in recent years  even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia  and most American cities never built any in the first place. The major subways in the Northeast  —   in New York  Washington and Boston  —   are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls  with Washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems. With mounting bills for basic maintenance  these subways have largely failed to grow. So the arrival of the   Second Avenue subway  which was first proposed in the 1920s  was a notable achievement for the   Metropolitan Transportation Authority  which runs the city’s vast network of subways  buses and commuter railroads. The first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about $4. 4 billion. With the opening  the map of the city’s loved and loathed subway adds three new stations  bringing the total to 472  —   the most of any subway in the world. A station that opened at Hudson Yards on Manhattan’s Far West Side in 2015 was the city’s first new station in a  . On Sunday  New Yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls. At the 72nd Street stop  Sumana Harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari  looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was overcome with emotion. “I don’t think I’ve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen ” she said through tears. “This woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin. ” She and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance. “Representation matters ” they agreed. Ms. Harihareswara  a longtime transit enthusiast from Astoria  Queens  said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics  including a mural of a gay couple holding hands. “There is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of New York ” Ms. Harihareswara said. After decades of aborted efforts to build the Second Avenue line  and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s  construction on the current segment began in 2007. The line was originally projected to open in 2013  but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo  a Democrat who effectively controls the authority  pressed officials to meet the December 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time. Still  the agency made the deadline  —   just barely  —   with a lavish inaugural ride on New Year’s Eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast. Although many New Yorkers believe the city runs the subways  it is actually the governor who appoints the authority’s chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency. Mr. Cuomo has capitalized on the Second Avenue opening to raise his national profile  overshadowing his frequent nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio  a Democrat who attended the inaugural ride on Saturday but was not given a speaking slot. Despite general good will over the opening  some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th Street in East Harlem as planned. On Sunday morning  Mr. Cuomo arrived at the 96th Street station with the authority’s chairman  Thomas F. Prendergast  to join the first trip for regular riders  who cheered as the train pulled out of the station. Then Mr. Cuomo’s voice came over the loudspeaker. “Rest assured: I’m not driving the train ” he joked. The first day of service was smooth  although there were a few hiccups. Around 3 p. m. there were delays on the Q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the City Hall station. About an hour earlier  the elevator at the new 86th Street stop had begun to malfunction  stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. Jill Tallmer  62  and her mother  Margot Tallmer  91  contemplated visiting another day. “We’ve been waiting for 10 years  or more  to ride ” the younger Ms. Tallmer said while standing with her mother  a lifelong New Yorker who is in a wheelchair. “Hopefully  it’s almost ready for us. ” It was not  and they left after a few minutes. At the 72nd Street station  George Braith  a jazz saxophonist  was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. The reason for his newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic there. “Would you look at that guy?” Mr. Braith  77  said. “Pretty handsome fellow if you ask me. ” He is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork  including chef Daniel Boulud. In Mr. Braith’s mosaic  he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature Braithophone  alto and soprano saxophones melded into one. Taking the instrument from his suitcase  he obliged the crowd with a brief tune. “Are you famous?” a   asked  seeing the hubbub. “In the jazz world ” Mr. Braith replied. The man shook his head and said  “Well  you’re immortalized as far as I’m concerned. ” Another   celebrant  Ian Ma  15  lives in Sheepshead Bay  a waterfront neighborhood in southern Brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line. But he has been enchanted by trains since he started rolling toy models on the floor as a child  he said  and he cajoled his parents into giving him a ride. “I feel like I’ve been waiting for this train my whole life ” he said "  pages into the   journal found in Dylann S. Roof’s car  —   after the assertions of black inferiority  the lamentations over white powerlessness  the longing for a race war  —   comes an incongruous declaration. “I want state that I am morally opposed to psychology ” wrote the young white supremacist who would murder nine black worshipers at Emanuel A. M. E. Church in Charleston  S. C. in June 2015. “It is a Jewish invention  and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they dont. ” Mr. Roof  who plans to represent himself when the penalty phase of his federal capital trial begins on Tuesday  apparently is devoted enough to that proposition (or delusion  as some maintain) to stake his life on it. Although a defense based on his psychological capacity might be his best opportunity to avoid execution  he seems steadfastly committed to preventing any public examination of his mental state or background. “I will not be calling mental health experts or presenting mental health evidence ” he wrote to Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court on Dec. 16  a day after a jury took only two hours to find him guilty of 33 counts  including hate crimes resulting in death  obstruction of religion and firearms violations. At a hearing on Wednesday  Mr. Roof told the judge that he planned to make an opening statement but not call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf. The testimony presented by prosecutors during the guilt phase of Mr. Roof’s trial detailed with gruesome precision how he had plotted and executed the massacre during a Wednesday night Bible study in the church’s fellowship hall. It was less satisfying in revealing why he had done it. With his choice to sideline his legal team and represent himself  the second phase  —   when the same jury of nine whites and three blacks will decide whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison  —   may prove little different. Death penalty experts said it was exceedingly rare for capital defendants to represent themselves after allowing lawyers to handle the initial part of a case. Mr. Roof  who also faces a death penalty trial in state court  has not publicly explained his reasoning. But legal filings strongly suggest a split with his   defenders about whether to argue that his rampage resulted from mental illness. Mr. Roof’s lead lawyer  David I. Bruck  tried repeatedly to plant that notion during the guilt phase  knowing it might be his only chance. Because evidence of mitigating factors is supposed to be reserved for the penalty phase  Judge Gergel allowed him little leeway. In his closing argument  while acknowledging Mr. Roof’s guilt  Mr. Bruck managed to tell the jury that Mr. Roof subscribed to “the mad idea that he can make things better by massacring the most virtuous  kind and gentle people he could ever have found. ” Mr. Bruck seeded his speech with words like “abnormal ” “irrationality ” “senselessness ” “delusional ” “obsession” and “perseveration ” a psychiatric term referring to the uncontrollable repetition of a particular response. Mr. Bruck  one of the country’s most experienced death penalty litigators  portrayed his    client as a loner whose most meaningful relationship seemed to be with his cat who staged hundreds of photographs of himself with no sign of friends whose racial hatred was ignited by internet searches and not personal experience who could not pinpoint during his confession to the F. B. I. how many he had killed  how long he had spent at the church or even what month it was who had no escape plan and left suicide notes to his parents. “There was something in him that made him feel that he had to do it ” Mr. Bruck said  “and that is as much as he knows. ” After receiving the results of a psychiatric examination in November  Judge Gergel found Mr. Roof competent to stand trial  —   meaning that he was capable of understanding the proceedings and assisting in his defense. At Mr. Bruck’s request  the judge scheduled a second competency hearing for Monday  but he signaled last week that he saw no reason to delay the penalty phase. The judge has repeatedly warned Mr. Roof against representing himself  including immediately after the verdicts  when he called it “a bad decision” and urged him to “fully appreciate the implications. ” The warnings have had no discernible effect on Mr. Roof  who has until Tuesday to reverse his decision to relegate his lawyers to standby counsel. That status allows Mr. Bruck and his team to offer guidance  but not to question witnesses or make objections. Prosecutors plan a procession of grief  perhaps calling dozens of members of victims’ families to testify about the impact of the killings. The prosecutors are also likely to   the considerable evidence of Mr. Roof’s premeditation and clearly articulated racial intent. Death penalty experts said the absence of mental health evidence to mitigate those aggravating factors could be decisive. “If the jury views Roof as evil and having made a knowing  intelligent choice to kill these innocent  churchgoing people in order to foment racial hatred  they are much more likely to impose the death penalty than if they believe him to be a young and severely mentally ill person who acted under delusional racist beliefs ” said Robert Dunham  executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center  a research group. It would take only one holdout on the jury  which consists of 10 women and two men  to spare Mr. Roof from lethal injection. Judge Gergel has ruled that the jurors can be told that prosecutors had rejected Mr. Roof’s offer  through Mr. Bruck  to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Many in Charleston were relieved by Mr. Roof’s conviction in light of the mistrial that had been declared 10 days earlier in the state murder prosecution of Michael T. Slager  the white North Charleston policeman whose fatal shooting of a black motorist in 2015 was captured on video. Even those who oppose the death penalty on moral grounds  like the Rev. Joseph A. Darby  a presiding elder for the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston  said it would seem bewildering for Mr. Roof to escape capital punishment. “That could very well be the end of the death penalty in America  because if there was ever justification for killing anybody  this is the case ” Mr. Darby said. There is no consensus among members of the victims’ families about Mr. Roof’s fate. When the Justice Department elected in May to seek the death penalty  it acted against the wishes of many and of the two women he had spared. Five relatives offered Mr. Roof a measure of forgiveness at a remarkable bond hearing two days after the shootings. But by law  those who testify now are prohibited from telling the jury what penalty they think he should receive. “It’s going to be extremely emotional  powerful testimony ” said John H. Blume  a death penalty expert who teaches at Cornell Law School  “and that emotion could implicitly and misleadingly indicate to the jury that some of these people want the death penalty when it’s not the case. ” If Mr. Roof is sentenced to death  it will be the first time a jury has done so in a prosecution involving the federal hate crimes law  according to experts on capital cases. That statute  which was broadened in 2009  does not carry a potential death sentence  but Mr. Roof was also convicted of other crimes that do. A death sentence most likely would give way to a yearslong series of appeals (in which Mr. Roof could not represent himself). Among the issues could be the composition of the jury  given that Mr. Roof acted rather passively as his own lawyer when it was selected the withholding of evidence on mental health and other mitigating factors and Mr. Roof’s competence to stand trial and to represent himself. In 2008  the Supreme Court ruled in Indiana v. Edwards that trial judges could insist on legal representation for defendants who are “competent enough to stand trial but who suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves. ” Mr. Bruck and his team have argued in court filings that Mr. Roof  a   dropout  “has no right to represent himself in a capital trial  and even less so at the penalty phase. ” But in the 41 years since the Supreme Court recognized a Sixth Amendment right of   for criminal defendants  in Faretta v. California  the court has never specifically narrowed that holding for death penalty trials  despite their complexity. Some death penalty opponents hope that Mr. Roof’s defiance will prompt the appellate courts to adopt a more rigorous standard for capital defendants. “Whether or not they’re legally insane  there’s certainly something mentally wrong with them ” said Peter D. Greenspun  a lawyer who was ousted by a defendant  John A. Muhammad  for part of a capital murder trial for the 2002 sniper attacks in the Washington area. He added  “To have a person like that make this kind of decision  it really calls into question  from a philosophical point of view  whether that person is in a position to understand their civil liberties. ” Mr. Muhammad  who ultimately reinstated Mr. Greenspun  was sentenced to death in 2003 and executed six years later. “It’s something that Roof will likely regret ” Mr. Greenspun predicted of his choice to represent himself. “At some point down the road  he’s going to say 1.0 "MUMBAI  India  —   It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire. The announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in India  which came into full effect at midnight Friday  the last day for depositing the old notes at banks  set off cash shortages that have hit the country’s most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy. But despite those concerns  as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do  for the moment  at least  Mr. Modi’s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena. Even as the poorest Indians have struggled  many have continued to voice support for the prime minister’s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money  known as “black money ” flowing through the country’s economy  in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr. Modi  analysts say  has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government. “Even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family  I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country ” said Hem Raj Chechi  39  a taxi driver in New Delhi  the capital  who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced. Mr. Chechi has not been able to pay his children’s school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months. But  he said  “We need to fight black money  even though it is hurting little people like me. ” Mr. Modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in New Delhi  bring jobs and fight corruption. Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption  widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless. Declaring war on corruption  Mr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that 500 and 1  000 rupee bills  worth about $8 and $15  would be banned the next morning. With the currency ban  Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side. He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the   good. That frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many Americans to vote for   Donald J. Trump last year  said Eswar S. Prasad  an economics professor at Cornell University who is a native of India. “Trump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system ” Mr. Prasad said in an interview. “Modi  in the same way  did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can’t tackle   problems like corruption. We needed big and painful changes  really disruptive ones. ” Mr. Modi appeared on television on New Year’s Eve to tell Indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation. He compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by Mohandas K. Gandhi  a battle of good versus evil. “Today Mahatma Gandhi is not among us  but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate ” Mr. Modi said  using the honorific for Gandhi. “As we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha ” he said  referring to Gandhi’s nonviolent resistance movement  “let us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness. ” Mr. Modi was presiding over one of the   major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes  which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation. “It’s a little bit crazy ” said Geng Xiao  a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. “When I first read the news  I couldn’t even figure out if it was true. ” The government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency  —   more than 250  000 rupees  or about $3  670  could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it. Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless. Whether Mr. Modi’s   move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate. Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy. But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption  even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones. And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it  which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term  economists say. People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard  their diets and livelihoods severely affected. Many in India see Mr. Modi  who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified    tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines  as living up to his promise to be a reformer of India’s ossified and bureaucratic economy. But in the process  he has placed the Indian economy and his political future at risk. Many economists believe that the Indian economy will take at least a   hit because of a dire shortage of cash  and that the future impact is uncertain. If the effects are prolonged  the public support for Modi could wane. “If this move damages the economy  he’s in for a rough ride ” said Harsh Pant  the head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation  a New Delhi think tank. Mr. Xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial  the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out. “You need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing ” he said. Mr. Modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014  defeating the government  led by the Indian National Congress party  that had ruled for most of the country’s   life  on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption. “In 2014  he had presented himself as the big disrupter ” Mr. Pant said. “He was the precursor to what’s happening in the West. ” Mr. Modi was then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat  where he had a reputation for tearing away the country’s red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand. But during his first two years after winning national election  Mr. Modi  whose party did not control the upper house of Parliament  struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul. Mr. Modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get Parliament to clear the way for the simplified    tax. He cast the opposition as “people who don’t want change  who don’t want reform ” Mr. Pant said  forcing them in August to support the changes. But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable. Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place  the currency shortage remains acute  leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings  many providers said. Nagender Tiwari  42  a rickshaw driver in East Delhi  said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1  000 rupees  or about $15  that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result  his family  which includes two children in 11th grade  has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home  he said. He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption  noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes. “So if bribery is not stopped  how can black money be stopped?” he asked. Raj Kumar Bindal  65  a paper trader in New Delhi  said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before. “We can’t shift to a cashless mode overnight ” he said. Surjit Bhalla  a New   economic adviser for the Observatory Group in New York  said he believed Mr. Modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months  possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax. India needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat  Mr. Bhalla said. In the United States  for every $100 collected in income tax  an estimated $20 owed is not paid  he added. In India  for that same $100 in taxes paid  $200 more is owed  he said. Collectively  the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform India  Mr. Pant and others said. But doing so depends on Mr. Modi’s continuing to command the political narrative of the country  as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban. “So far  he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him ” Mr. Pant said. “He thinks he can continue to do it
