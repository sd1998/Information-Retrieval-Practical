"DORAL  Fla.  —   Inside a clandestine Carnival Corporation complex here  two former Disney executives have been plotting a drastic cruise industry overhaul. Their mission: Take lessons learned at Walt Disney World  where they helped bring about a $1 billion vacation management system involving   bracelets that link to personal information  and apply them to cruises. The result: Millions of passengers on Carnival ships will soon be using a similar but more advanced system that allows travelers to do everything from plan vacations to open stateroom doors to order poolside cocktails. “As long as bigger  newer  cooler ships have kept coming  the cruise industry has treated guest liabilities  —   standing in long lines  having a frustrating embarkation experience  —   as acceptable ” said John Padgett  who joined Carnival in 2014 as chief experience and innovation officer after 18 years at Disney. “That thinking stops now. ” Carnival  which operates more than 100 ships worldwide under 10 brands  will unveil its ambitious technology initiative on Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. In a keynote speech  Arnold W. Donald  Carnival’s chief executive  intends to announce that the system  —   an app called Ocean Compass paired with a     smart medallion that can be carried in a pocket or worn as jewelry  —   will arrive on the company’s Princess Cruises fleet this year. Mr. Donald declined in an interview to give a timeline for bringing the technology (code name: Trident) to other Carnival brands. But he emphasized that rolling out the personalized disks and app was a companywide priority. “The cost is in the hundreds of millions of dollars  and  over time  more than that ” Mr. Donald said. “People want the world to be organized around them. On vacation  even more so. ” Analysts expect the technology to increase profits in multiple ways  including allowing Carnival to charge more for tickets  particularly on older ships. Ease of purchase is another big component  —   cruisers will be able to pay for food  drinks and merchandise simply by having their credit   Ocean Medallion in their pocket. Carnival’s disks  each   with the guest’s name  will also power a new  shipwide gambling platform. And Carnival gift shops will be stocked with a wide array of jewelry  clips and key chains that passengers can buy to carry and display their disks. Carnival’s top rival  Royal Caribbean Cruises  already offers smartbands on   ships like the Anthem of the Seas. Called WOW bands  they serve as room keys  allow for wireless payment and make it faster and easier to embark and disembark. But Carnival says that its offering takes such systems much further  in part because its technology is designed to be invisible. Unlike with smartbands  there is no need to tap a sensor on a stateroom door for entry simply approaching the correct room with the Ocean Medallion in your pocket will unlock the door. Among the medallion system’s other offerings is a navigation tool designed to help family members find one another on the   ships. Under Mr. Donald  who took over Carnival in   after a string of ship debacles  the company has boomed. In the most recent quarter  Carnival had a record $1. 4 billion in net income  a 17 percent increase from the same period a year earlier. But he remains under pressure to recruit new customers. About 24. 2 million people worldwide took a cruise in 2016  according to the Cruise Lines International Association. That sounds like a lot  but “cruise vacations only represent about 2 percent of all vacations ” said David Beckel  an analyst at Bernstein Research. “Because there is such a low penetration rate  any increase in penetration  —   even a minor  minor one  —   represents a big difference  and hence the effort to improve the customer experience ” Mr. Beckel said. As part of its Ocean Medallion plan  Carnival has turned to television  paying to produce three travel shows designed to make cruising look fun and easy. The shows has been broadcast on weekends in recent months on ABC  NBC and the CW. In one   episode of “The Voyager with Josh Garcia ” the host is seen chatting with artists in Puerto Rico about making masks from coconuts. Carnival plans to produce at least 80 episodes in total. Analysts have praised the effort. “People have a lot of preconceived notions about cruising that largely aren’t true ” said Robin M. Farley  an analyst for UBS. The system that Carnival plans to introduce on Thursday still has a lot to prove. The technology will require the mass retraining of employees and substantial retrofitting of ships  including the installation of roughly 7  000 sensors per boat. And do passengers really want to sacrifice privacy for personalization? One feature will allow guests to watch live entertainment in ship lounges on their stateroom televisions  —   and the performers will know who is watching and will be trained to do  . (“Hello to Brooks  tuning in from his bed on the Promenade Deck! ”) Mr. Padgett acknowledged that some guests will have “creepiness factor” questions. But he expects the vast majority to participate. “As long as you benefit the guest  they don’t mind sharing” personal information  he said. Using the connected app  guests can order food to be delivered wherever they plan to be at a designated time. (Waiters will know who you are because your photograph will pop up on an   device when they get close to your medallion.) By loading preferences into the app while still at home  Carnival will be able to offer tailored lists of activities. “The goal of preplanning is learning more about our guests ” said Michael G. Jungen  who joined Carnival in 2015 as vice president for design and technology after 15 years at Disney. He noted that passengers would have the option of linking their medallions with social media accounts  allowing Carnival to delve even deeper. As Carnival designed the Ocean Medallion system inside an unmarked building here in suburban Miami  it built a replica set of staterooms  corridors and other ship facilities to test concepts. Scribbles on a monumental white board in one area contained algorithms and personalization ideas. (“What time you eat dinner. What channels you watch. ”) When they were leading Disney’s technology effort in 2013  Mr. Padgett and Mr. Jungen built a similar laboratory  experimenting with ideas that ultimately became MyMagic+ the theme park wristband system that serves as wallet  room key  admission ticket  photograph collector and   pass. As he gave a reporter a tour of the Carnival site  Mr. Padgett continually returned to the topic of Disney  —   how the cost of cruising compares with a family trip to Disney World  and how Disney frames vacations as overarching stories. “The ultimate goal here ” he said  turning to a   Disney phrase "The nation’s consumer watchdog agency on Tuesday ordered the   agencies TransUnion and Equifax to pay more than $23. 2 million in fines and restitution for deceiving customers about the usefulness of credit scores and the cost of obtaining them. The watchdog agency  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  said the payments would resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax had lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $1  but which could cost more than $200 a year. TransUnion will reimburse $13. 93 million to consumers and pay a $3 million civil fine  while Equifax will reimburse $3. 8 million and pay a $2. 5 million civil fine  the bureau said. Both companies will also modify their marketing practices. Among the changes  they will obtain customers’ consent to enroll them in services in which fees begin after free trials and make it easier for them to cancel services they do not want. The bureau said the wrongful conduct had violated the     law and had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014. Many lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion  Equifax and their rival Experian when lending money. But TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented the credit scores they sold to consumers as being the same scores that lenders used  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. “Credit scores are central to a consumer’s financial life  and people deserve honest and accurate information about them ” Richard Cordray  the bureau’s director  said in a statement. Neither TransUnion  which is based in Chicago  nor Equifax  which is based in Atlanta  admitted or denied wrongdoing. A TransUnion spokesman  David Blumberg  and an Equifax spokeswoman  Ines Gutzmer  said their companies believed that they had complied with the law and were committed to better educating consumers about their credit. Experian was not charged. A spokesman for the bureau did not immediately have additional comment. In 2015  under a separate settlement with 31 state attorneys general 2017-01-04 2017.0 1.0 "LONDON  —   Maybe it wasn’t just the iceberg. Ever since the Titanic sank more than 104 years ago  killing more than 1  500 men  women and children  mystery has swirled around the tragedy. No one doubts that the ship collided at high speed with an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland. But a new documentary posits that the sinking of the ship  —   hailed at the time as the largest ever built  and praised for its professed unsinkability  —   may have been accelerated by a giant coal fire in its hull that appeared to have started as long as three weeks before it set off on its fateful journey to New York from Southampton  England. In the documentary  which was broadcast on Channel 4 in Britain on New Year’s Day  Senan Molony  an Irish journalist who has spent more than 30 years researching the Titanic  contends that the fire  in a    bunker next to one of the ship’s boiler rooms  damaged its hull  helping to seal its fate long before it slammed into the iceberg. “It’s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire  ice and criminal negligence ” he argues in the documentary  “Titanic: The New Evidence ” which will air in the United States on the Smithsonian Channel on January 21. “The fire was known about  but it was played down. She should never have been put to sea. ” Mr. Molony’s potential breakthrough can be traced to an attic in Wiltshire  in southwest England  where a previously unpublished album of photographs chronicling the ship’s construction and the preparations for its maiden voyage had been gathering dust for more than a century. The photographs were discovered by a descendant of a director of the   company  Harland and Wolff  that built the Titanic. About four years ago  a collaborator of Mr. Molony’s acquired the rare photographs of the ship  meticulously taken by Harland and Wolff’s engineering chief before it left a Belfast shipyard. When the two men looked closely at the images  Mr. Molony said  they were shocked to discover a    diagonal black mark on the hull’s front starboard side  close to where the ship was pierced by the iceberg. An analysis by engineers at Imperial College London subsequently revealed that the mark was most likely caused by a fire in a coal bunker of the ship. Mr. Molony called the photographs “the Titanic equivalent of Tutankhamen’s tomb ” because of the richness of historical detail they conveyed  including the mark highlighting the extent of the damage. Experts said the theory was compelling but were divided over how important a role the fire may have played. In an interview  Richard de Kerbrech  a marine engineer based on the Isle of Wight who has written two books on the Titanic disaster  said that the fire would have damaged the ship’s bulkhead  a wall of steel within the ship’s hull  and made it more vulnerable after it was pierced by an iceberg. An official British inquiry  in 1912  mentioned the fire  but the judge who presided over it  whom critics saw as sympathetic to shipping interests  played it down. “This discovery is a revelation and could change our knowledge of the history of what happened ” Mr. de Kerbrech said. Mr. Molony contends that the ship’s owners knew about the fire but chose to let it go  since delaying the ship’s journey would have been financially ruinous. At the time of departure  the ship was berthed so that the marks caused by the fire were facing the sea  away from the dock  and therefore concealed from passengers. The Titanic disaster has long fanned conspiracy theories  among them that it was not the Titanic that sank on April 15  1912  but  rather the Olympic  its sister ship that the Titanic was torpedoed by a German   or that the ship was brought down by a sarcophagus containing an Egyptian priestess’s mummy. Popularized by Hollywood  the story of the Titanic continues to exert a hold on popular culture. Construction of a   replica recently began at a theme park in China. Mr. Molony said his fascination took root when he was 12 and was gripped by “A Night to Remember ” Walter Lord’s 1955 book recounting the Titanic’s final night. He said he was so captivated that he finished the book in two hours and 40 minutes  the same time it took the Titanic to sink. Now the political editor at The Irish Daily Mail  Mr. Molony  who has also written a book called “The Irish Aboard Titanic ” was also drawn to the social divisions reflected on the ship  where   cabins hosted millionaires while hundreds of   passengers  many of them Irish  stayed below. Mr. Molony said he believed the fire had been played down  in part because death by iceberg was a more dramatic explanation. “The ship was seen as a heroic unsinkable ship and  as a result  people focused on explanations that fed that narrative ” he said. Not everyone is convinced. David Hill  a former honorary secretary of the British Titanic Society  who has been studying the cause of the sinking since the 1950s  argued that  while the damage caused by the fire to the steel walls protecting the hull may have hastened the disaster  the blaze was not the decisive factor. “When the Titanic hit the iceberg close to midnight on April 14  1912  it created a    line of damage on the starboard section of the hull  including punctures and gashes  that opened up too many compartments to the sea  so that the weight of the water dragged the bow down so low that the ship eventually sank ” he said. “A fire may have accelerated this. But in my view "When a Wall Street banking institution starts throwing   bonuses at credit card customers  it may be best to grab them before they inevitably disappear. And so it goes with Chase Sapphire Reserve  a card that the bank  JPMorgan Chase  introduced last summer. The bank offered a   bonus worth $1  500 to people who spent $4  000 on the card in the first three months they had it and then redeemed the bonus for travel. Now the bank is cutting the bonus in half. Jan. 12 will be the last day that people can earn it by applying for the card online  though people who apply at a bank branch will still be able to get the bonus until March 12. You need not be a current bank customer to apply at a branch  according to a bank spokeswoman  Ashley E. Dodd  who confirmed the changes. The bonus played a big role in bringing the card so much attention  landing it on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek and leading the bank to hand out so many perks that it caused a $200 million to $300 million hit to its earnings. Even without the outsize bonus  which was very rare in the history of credit card bonus offers  the card is likely to remain popular. While it has a steep $450 annual fee  cardholders receive a $300 credit each year for any travel spending they put on the card. And customers earn three points for every dollar they spend on all travel and dining  which can lead to better value than the rewards that most other cards offer for customers who spent a lot in those areas. The Points Guy blog first reported the slashing of the   bonus. Many such sites now exist to help consumers take advantage of the most lucrative   offers  while collecting commissions when they pass readers on to card issuers’ application sites. If those customers keep the cards for a few years (and especially if they run up balances and pay interest) the banks can come out ahead. With too many people gaming the offer  however  bank profitability can suffer "Broadway rang out 2016 with a very big bang. The 33 plays and musicals running last week brought in a whopping $49. 7 million  making it the   week in Broadway history. It was also the   week on record  with 359  495 people seeing Broadway shows. All around Times Square  records were toppled like pins in a bowling alley: It was the best week ever for   shows like “Chicago ” “Jersey Boys” and “The Lion King” the most money ever grossed at multiple theaters built more than a century ago (for example  $911  000 by “Oh  Hello” at the Lyceum  which was built in 1903) the most performances ever by a single show during a   period (17  by “The Illusionists”) and the most money ever grossed by a single show ($3. 3 million  by “Hamilton”). An astonishing 24 shows grossed more than $1 million last week  including seven that grossed more than $2 million  according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League. Three shows topped the $3 million mark: “Hamilton ” “Wicked” and “The Lion King. ” The grosses for the week ending Jan. 1 were 63 percent higher than the previous week  and 15 percent higher than the same week the previous year (even though there were five more shows playing at the same time last year). Why? The most significant factor appears to be pricing: The base prices for many Broadway shows are high  and the premium prices charged over the holiday period were even higher.   shows had an average price over $100. And for “Hamilton ” now the industry leader in pricing  the average price was $310  and the top price was $998. (That’s the price charged by the box office the first time a ticket was sold many people paid higher prices purchasing from resellers.) There were other factors contributing to the Broadway bonanza. New York City was wrapping up a banner year for tourism: an estimated 60. 3 million visitors  up from 58. 5 million the previous year  according to Christopher Heywood  a spokesman for NYC  Company  the city’s tourism agency. The period between Christmas and New Year’s is always popular for tourists  —   and lucrative for Broadway  —   but especially so this winter  because Christmas and New Year’s fell on weekends  and many people took off work the week in between. Multiple shows that aim heavily at tourists did extraordinarily well. For example: Cirque du Soleil’s first Broadway venture  “Paramour ” had its best week yet  at $1. 9 million  and “The Phantom of the Opera ” the   Broadway show and a reliable barometer for tourist traffic  had its best week too  also at $1. 9 million. Broadway took advantage of the expected high tourism last week by staging more performances. The usual Broadway schedule sees shows staged eight times a week  but last week 25 shows had nine performances. And then there was “The Illusionists ” a holiday season magic show  which managed to have 17 performances by scheduling shows three times a day Monday through Friday  and then twice on Sunday. Other factors: Broadway is on an upswing. Grosses and attendance have been growing for several years  and the current season has already featured strong starts for three new musicals: “Natasha  Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 ” “A Bronx Tale” and “Dear Evan Hansen. ” “The record just broken for both attendance and grosses for the last week reflects the continuing success of the range of theater being produced on Broadway ” said Charlotte St. Martin  the president of the Broadway League. Several shows that had announced closing dates had a surge of   patrons. “Matilda” closed on Sunday after its best week ($1. 9 million) and “Jersey Boys ” which closes on Jan. 15  set a record  too ($1. 8 million). Some plays benefited as well: “The Humans ” which won the Tony for best new play last year  grossed an impressive $815  000 as it prepared to close on Jan. 15. Of course  the good news is not likely to last. January and February are generally soft months for Broadway. Thirteen shows are scheduled to close between Dec. 31 and Jan. 29
