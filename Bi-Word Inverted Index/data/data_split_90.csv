"DORAL  Fla.  —   Inside a clandestine Carnival Corporation complex here  two former Disney executives have been plotting a drastic cruise industry overhaul. Their mission: Take lessons learned at Walt Disney World  where they helped bring about a $1 billion vacation management system involving   bracelets that link to personal information  and apply them to cruises. The result: Millions of passengers on Carnival ships will soon be using a similar but more advanced system that allows travelers to do everything from plan vacations to open stateroom doors to order poolside cocktails. “As long as bigger  newer  cooler ships have kept coming  the cruise industry has treated guest liabilities  —   standing in long lines  having a frustrating embarkation experience  —   as acceptable ” said John Padgett  who joined Carnival in 2014 as chief experience and innovation officer after 18 years at Disney. “That thinking stops now. ” Carnival  which operates more than 100 ships worldwide under 10 brands  will unveil its ambitious technology initiative on Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. In a keynote speech  Arnold W. Donald  Carnival’s chief executive  intends to announce that the system  —   an app called Ocean Compass paired with a     smart medallion that can be carried in a pocket or worn as jewelry  —   will arrive on the company’s Princess Cruises fleet this year. Mr. Donald declined in an interview to give a timeline for bringing the technology (code name: Trident) to other Carnival brands. But he emphasized that rolling out the personalized disks and app was a companywide priority. “The cost is in the hundreds of millions of dollars  and  over time  more than that ” Mr. Donald said. “People want the world to be organized around them. On vacation  even more so. ” Analysts expect the technology to increase profits in multiple ways  including allowing Carnival to charge more for tickets  particularly on older ships. Ease of purchase is another big component  —   cruisers will be able to pay for food  drinks and merchandise simply by having their credit   Ocean Medallion in their pocket. Carnival’s disks  each   with the guest’s name  will also power a new  shipwide gambling platform. And Carnival gift shops will be stocked with a wide array of jewelry  clips and key chains that passengers can buy to carry and display their disks. Carnival’s top rival  Royal Caribbean Cruises  already offers smartbands on   ships like the Anthem of the Seas. Called WOW bands  they serve as room keys  allow for wireless payment and make it faster and easier to embark and disembark. But Carnival says that its offering takes such systems much further  in part because its technology is designed to be invisible. Unlike with smartbands  there is no need to tap a sensor on a stateroom door for entry simply approaching the correct room with the Ocean Medallion in your pocket will unlock the door. Among the medallion system’s other offerings is a navigation tool designed to help family members find one another on the   ships. Under Mr. Donald  who took over Carnival in   after a string of ship debacles  the company has boomed. In the most recent quarter  Carnival had a record $1. 4 billion in net income  a 17 percent increase from the same period a year earlier. But he remains under pressure to recruit new customers. About 24. 2 million people worldwide took a cruise in 2016  according to the Cruise Lines International Association. That sounds like a lot  but “cruise vacations only represent about 2 percent of all vacations ” said David Beckel  an analyst at Bernstein Research. “Because there is such a low penetration rate  any increase in penetration  —   even a minor  minor one  —   represents a big difference  and hence the effort to improve the customer experience ” Mr. Beckel said. As part of its Ocean Medallion plan  Carnival has turned to television  paying to produce three travel shows designed to make cruising look fun and easy. The shows has been broadcast on weekends in recent months on ABC  NBC and the CW. In one   episode of “The Voyager with Josh Garcia ” the host is seen chatting with artists in Puerto Rico about making masks from coconuts. Carnival plans to produce at least 80 episodes in total. Analysts have praised the effort. “People have a lot of preconceived notions about cruising that largely aren’t true ” said Robin M. Farley  an analyst for UBS. The system that Carnival plans to introduce on Thursday still has a lot to prove. The technology will require the mass retraining of employees and substantial retrofitting of ships  including the installation of roughly 7  000 sensors per boat. And do passengers really want to sacrifice privacy for personalization? One feature will allow guests to watch live entertainment in ship lounges on their stateroom televisions  —   and the performers will know who is watching and will be trained to do  . (“Hello to Brooks  tuning in from his bed on the Promenade Deck! ”) Mr. Padgett acknowledged that some guests will have “creepiness factor” questions. But he expects the vast majority to participate. “As long as you benefit the guest  they don’t mind sharing” personal information  he said. Using the connected app  guests can order food to be delivered wherever they plan to be at a designated time. (Waiters will know who you are because your photograph will pop up on an   device when they get close to your medallion.) By loading preferences into the app while still at home  Carnival will be able to offer tailored lists of activities. “The goal of preplanning is learning more about our guests ” said Michael G. Jungen  who joined Carnival in 2015 as vice president for design and technology after 15 years at Disney. He noted that passengers would have the option of linking their medallions with social media accounts  allowing Carnival to delve even deeper. As Carnival designed the Ocean Medallion system inside an unmarked building here in suburban Miami  it built a replica set of staterooms  corridors and other ship facilities to test concepts. Scribbles on a monumental white board in one area contained algorithms and personalization ideas. (“What time you eat dinner. What channels you watch. ”) When they were leading Disney’s technology effort in 2013  Mr. Padgett and Mr. Jungen built a similar laboratory  experimenting with ideas that ultimately became MyMagic+ the theme park wristband system that serves as wallet  room key  admission ticket  photograph collector and   pass. As he gave a reporter a tour of the Carnival site  Mr. Padgett continually returned to the topic of Disney  —   how the cost of cruising compares with a family trip to Disney World  and how Disney frames vacations as overarching stories. “The ultimate goal here ” he said  turning to a   Disney phrase "The nation’s consumer watchdog agency on Tuesday ordered the   agencies TransUnion and Equifax to pay more than $23. 2 million in fines and restitution for deceiving customers about the usefulness of credit scores and the cost of obtaining them. The watchdog agency  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  said the payments would resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax had lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $1  but which could cost more than $200 a year. TransUnion will reimburse $13. 93 million to consumers and pay a $3 million civil fine  while Equifax will reimburse $3. 8 million and pay a $2. 5 million civil fine  the bureau said. Both companies will also modify their marketing practices. Among the changes  they will obtain customers’ consent to enroll them in services in which fees begin after free trials and make it easier for them to cancel services they do not want. The bureau said the wrongful conduct had violated the     law and had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014. Many lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion  Equifax and their rival Experian when lending money. But TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented the credit scores they sold to consumers as being the same scores that lenders used  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. “Credit scores are central to a consumer’s financial life  and people deserve honest and accurate information about them ” Richard Cordray  the bureau’s director  said in a statement. Neither TransUnion  which is based in Chicago  nor Equifax  which is based in Atlanta  admitted or denied wrongdoing. A TransUnion spokesman  David Blumberg  and an Equifax spokeswoman  Ines Gutzmer  said their companies believed that they had complied with the law and were committed to better educating consumers about their credit. Experian was not charged. A spokesman for the bureau did not immediately have additional comment. In 2015  under a separate settlement with 31 state attorneys general 2017-01-04 2017.0 1.0 "LONDON  —   Maybe it wasn’t just the iceberg. Ever since the Titanic sank more than 104 years ago  killing more than 1  500 men  women and children  mystery has swirled around the tragedy. No one doubts that the ship collided at high speed with an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland. But a new documentary posits that the sinking of the ship  —   hailed at the time as the largest ever built  and praised for its professed unsinkability  —   may have been accelerated by a giant coal fire in its hull that appeared to have started as long as three weeks before it set off on its fateful journey to New York from Southampton  England. In the documentary  which was broadcast on Channel 4 in Britain on New Year’s Day  Senan Molony  an Irish journalist who has spent more than 30 years researching the Titanic  contends that the fire  in a    bunker next to one of the ship’s boiler rooms  damaged its hull  helping to seal its fate long before it slammed into the iceberg. “It’s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire  ice and criminal negligence ” he argues in the documentary  “Titanic: The New Evidence ” which will air in the United States on the Smithsonian Channel on January 21. “The fire was known about  but it was played down. She should never have been put to sea. ” Mr. Molony’s potential breakthrough can be traced to an attic in Wiltshire  in southwest England  where a previously unpublished album of photographs chronicling the ship’s construction and the preparations for its maiden voyage had been gathering dust for more than a century. The photographs were discovered by a descendant of a director of the   company  Harland and Wolff  that built the Titanic. About four years ago  a collaborator of Mr. Molony’s acquired the rare photographs of the ship  meticulously taken by Harland and Wolff’s engineering chief before it left a Belfast shipyard. When the two men looked closely at the images  Mr. Molony said  they were shocked to discover a    diagonal black mark on the hull’s front starboard side  close to where the ship was pierced by the iceberg. An analysis by engineers at Imperial College London subsequently revealed that the mark was most likely caused by a fire in a coal bunker of the ship. Mr. Molony called the photographs “the Titanic equivalent of Tutankhamen’s tomb ” because of the richness of historical detail they conveyed  including the mark highlighting the extent of the damage. Experts said the theory was compelling but were divided over how important a role the fire may have played. In an interview  Richard de Kerbrech  a marine engineer based on the Isle of Wight who has written two books on the Titanic disaster  said that the fire would have damaged the ship’s bulkhead  a wall of steel within the ship’s hull  and made it more vulnerable after it was pierced by an iceberg. An official British inquiry  in 1912  mentioned the fire  but the judge who presided over it  whom critics saw as sympathetic to shipping interests  played it down. “This discovery is a revelation and could change our knowledge of the history of what happened ” Mr. de Kerbrech said. Mr. Molony contends that the ship’s owners knew about the fire but chose to let it go  since delaying the ship’s journey would have been financially ruinous. At the time of departure  the ship was berthed so that the marks caused by the fire were facing the sea  away from the dock  and therefore concealed from passengers. The Titanic disaster has long fanned conspiracy theories  among them that it was not the Titanic that sank on April 15  1912  but  rather the Olympic  its sister ship that the Titanic was torpedoed by a German   or that the ship was brought down by a sarcophagus containing an Egyptian priestess’s mummy. Popularized by Hollywood  the story of the Titanic continues to exert a hold on popular culture. Construction of a   replica recently began at a theme park in China. Mr. Molony said his fascination took root when he was 12 and was gripped by “A Night to Remember ” Walter Lord’s 1955 book recounting the Titanic’s final night. He said he was so captivated that he finished the book in two hours and 40 minutes  the same time it took the Titanic to sink. Now the political editor at The Irish Daily Mail  Mr. Molony  who has also written a book called “The Irish Aboard Titanic ” was also drawn to the social divisions reflected on the ship  where   cabins hosted millionaires while hundreds of   passengers  many of them Irish  stayed below. Mr. Molony said he believed the fire had been played down  in part because death by iceberg was a more dramatic explanation. “The ship was seen as a heroic unsinkable ship and  as a result  people focused on explanations that fed that narrative ” he said. Not everyone is convinced. David Hill  a former honorary secretary of the British Titanic Society  who has been studying the cause of the sinking since the 1950s  argued that  while the damage caused by the fire to the steel walls protecting the hull may have hastened the disaster  the blaze was not the decisive factor. “When the Titanic hit the iceberg close to midnight on April 14  1912  it created a    line of damage on the starboard section of the hull  including punctures and gashes  that opened up too many compartments to the sea  so that the weight of the water dragged the bow down so low that the ship eventually sank ” he said. “A fire may have accelerated this. But in my view "When a Wall Street banking institution starts throwing   bonuses at credit card customers  it may be best to grab them before they inevitably disappear. And so it goes with Chase Sapphire Reserve  a card that the bank  JPMorgan Chase  introduced last summer. The bank offered a   bonus worth $1  500 to people who spent $4  000 on the card in the first three months they had it and then redeemed the bonus for travel. Now the bank is cutting the bonus in half. Jan. 12 will be the last day that people can earn it by applying for the card online  though people who apply at a bank branch will still be able to get the bonus until March 12. You need not be a current bank customer to apply at a branch  according to a bank spokeswoman  Ashley E. Dodd  who confirmed the changes. The bonus played a big role in bringing the card so much attention  landing it on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek and leading the bank to hand out so many perks that it caused a $200 million to $300 million hit to its earnings. Even without the outsize bonus  which was very rare in the history of credit card bonus offers  the card is likely to remain popular. While it has a steep $450 annual fee  cardholders receive a $300 credit each year for any travel spending they put on the card. And customers earn three points for every dollar they spend on all travel and dining  which can lead to better value than the rewards that most other cards offer for customers who spent a lot in those areas. The Points Guy blog first reported the slashing of the   bonus. Many such sites now exist to help consumers take advantage of the most lucrative   offers  while collecting commissions when they pass readers on to card issuers’ application sites. If those customers keep the cards for a few years (and especially if they run up balances and pay interest) the banks can come out ahead. With too many people gaming the offer  however  bank profitability can suffer "Broadway rang out 2016 with a very big bang. The 33 plays and musicals running last week brought in a whopping $49. 7 million  making it the   week in Broadway history. It was also the   week on record  with 359  495 people seeing Broadway shows. All around Times Square  records were toppled like pins in a bowling alley: It was the best week ever for   shows like “Chicago ” “Jersey Boys” and “The Lion King” the most money ever grossed at multiple theaters built more than a century ago (for example  $911  000 by “Oh  Hello” at the Lyceum  which was built in 1903) the most performances ever by a single show during a   period (17  by “The Illusionists”) and the most money ever grossed by a single show ($3. 3 million  by “Hamilton”). An astonishing 24 shows grossed more than $1 million last week  including seven that grossed more than $2 million  according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League. Three shows topped the $3 million mark: “Hamilton ” “Wicked” and “The Lion King. ” The grosses for the week ending Jan. 1 were 63 percent higher than the previous week  and 15 percent higher than the same week the previous year (even though there were five more shows playing at the same time last year). Why? The most significant factor appears to be pricing: The base prices for many Broadway shows are high  and the premium prices charged over the holiday period were even higher.   shows had an average price over $100. And for “Hamilton ” now the industry leader in pricing  the average price was $310  and the top price was $998. (That’s the price charged by the box office the first time a ticket was sold many people paid higher prices purchasing from resellers.) There were other factors contributing to the Broadway bonanza. New York City was wrapping up a banner year for tourism: an estimated 60. 3 million visitors  up from 58. 5 million the previous year  according to Christopher Heywood  a spokesman for NYC  Company  the city’s tourism agency. The period between Christmas and New Year’s is always popular for tourists  —   and lucrative for Broadway  —   but especially so this winter  because Christmas and New Year’s fell on weekends  and many people took off work the week in between. Multiple shows that aim heavily at tourists did extraordinarily well. For example: Cirque du Soleil’s first Broadway venture  “Paramour ” had its best week yet  at $1. 9 million  and “The Phantom of the Opera ” the   Broadway show and a reliable barometer for tourist traffic  had its best week too  also at $1. 9 million. Broadway took advantage of the expected high tourism last week by staging more performances. The usual Broadway schedule sees shows staged eight times a week  but last week 25 shows had nine performances. And then there was “The Illusionists ” a holiday season magic show  which managed to have 17 performances by scheduling shows three times a day Monday through Friday  and then twice on Sunday. Other factors: Broadway is on an upswing. Grosses and attendance have been growing for several years  and the current season has already featured strong starts for three new musicals: “Natasha  Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 ” “A Bronx Tale” and “Dear Evan Hansen. ” “The record just broken for both attendance and grosses for the last week reflects the continuing success of the range of theater being produced on Broadway ” said Charlotte St. Martin  the president of the Broadway League. Several shows that had announced closing dates had a surge of   patrons. “Matilda” closed on Sunday after its best week ($1. 9 million) and “Jersey Boys ” which closes on Jan. 15  set a record  too ($1. 8 million). Some plays benefited as well: “The Humans ” which won the Tony for best new play last year  grossed an impressive $815  000 as it prepared to close on Jan. 15. Of course  the good news is not likely to last. January and February are generally soft months for Broadway. Thirteen shows are scheduled to close between Dec. 31 and Jan. 29 1.0 "LECCE  Italy  —   One of his first students was a young man he had arrested four years earlier. Others have been convicted of armed robbery  drug trafficking and criminal association with the mafia. The classrooms are frugally equipped  behind windows protected by vertical and horizontal bars  although one has brightly colored paintings covering the walls. But none of that deterred Marco Albanese  a police officer for 19 years and a trained sommelier for five  from teaching a class of rapt students the finer points of deconstructing the bouquet of a chardonnay or pouring a rare vintage. Mr. Albanese  43  is an instructor in an innovative effort at Lecce Penitentiary to teach inmates to be sommeliers  or wine stewards. The courses are part of a program to teach prisoners new professional skills  as well as to help them develop a bond with the region  which is renowned for its negroamaro grapes. The program has been enthusiastically embraced by the prisoner students  who were tasting white wines on a recent afternoon. It has also been an eye opener for Mr. Albanese. “I could see their human aspect  once they were out of their context ” Mr. Albanese  who traded in his police uniform for the crisp blue jacket and tie of a sommelier for the class. “And I didn’t have to keep the same distance  now that I was their ‘professor. ’” He added  “They also deserve a second chance  and it’s important that they know that the institutions do believe that they can be educated to a different life. ” In eight lessons  the group of 30 men and women  who are instructed in separate classes  learn how to taste  choose and serve local wines. “We hope to teach them the social value of work and the preciousness of their own territory  so that they can later choose to work here  already having the right skill set ” said Rita Russo  the director of Lecce Penitentiary  which is the largest in the region of Apulia. Inmates can also study for their high school diplomas  cultivate tomatoes  take theater classes and learn to be painters or tailors. Class begins with a slide show on the history of wine  explaining how it was drunk by the ancient Greeks and introducing the students to the Roman ancestors of modern sommeliers in Italy. On a school table  covered with a khaki tablecloth  stood wine glasses  ready for use. Three bottles of chardonnay  a red primitivo and a negroamaro stood on a table nearby. Mr. Albanese then addressed the prisoners  who sat facing him on stools listing the temperatures at which different wines should be served and how to store them in cellars. For a finale  he offered a   tip. “Do remember  even if you had Trump over for dinner  the pope would still be served first. The clergy does come first  even before heads of state ” he said  to raucous laughter. The prisoners  whose identity is being protected by the prison  were not allowed to be interviewed or photographed for this article. Roberto Giannone  who works for the local sommelier association  then demonstrated how to open a bottle  neatly slicing off the capsule covering the bottleneck in three cuts  inserting the corkscrew and smoothly pulling out the cork. “Once the cork is out ” he said  “use a napkin to show it to your customers. It’s an easy way to be polite and avoid objections. ” Since the 1970s  the Italian penal system has focused on   for inmates. However  a lack of funds for rehabilitation  as well as chronic overcrowding  means that thousands of incarcerated men and women have little to do all day. That has sparked some innovative rehabilitation programs  including a restaurant inside a   prison near Milan in which the waiters and cooks are inmates. But the sommelier class at the Lecce prison is believed to be unique in Italy. “Of course  sommelier courses can’t be considered a treatment ” said Georgia Zara  the head of a program at the University of Turin that offers a master’s degree in criminological and forensic psychology. “But they do educate inmates and create social interaction  which is very important. ” The classes also offer a “bridge between the jail context and the world outside  so it’s a small investment to reduce the risk of recidivism ” Ms. Zara said. Gianvito Rizzo  53  is the chief executive at the Feudi di Guagnano  a local vintner that provides wine  like negroamaro  for the classes. He is also the creator of the sommelier classes at the prison. Mr. Rizzo has proposed that inmates start working on his nearly 75 acres of vines in the coming year under certain circumstances  some inmates in Italy are allowed to work outside prisons. “I see wine in a democratic way ” Mr. Rizzo said as he walked through his vineyard recently. “The countryside is the opposite to a cell. You are free. You smell nature  and learn to care for it. I think it’d be good also for inmates to try it out. ” Mr. Rizzo said that when he had received a master’s degree from the Bocconi University business school in Milan three decades ago  he had been “fixated” on doing something for his native region of Salento  in Apulia  on the heel of the Italian boot. He settled on going into the wine business  which had been struggling to convert farmers who cultivated for personal or local use into becoming larger producers. He now produces 16 different wines from grapes grown in vineyards that he and two friends and business partners inherited from their fathers  added to those that other friends asked them to cultivate on their behalf. He calls this collaborative effort his “first social experiment. ” When Mr. Rizzo heard about the penitentiary’s activities for prisoners  he proposed the sommelier classes to Ms. Russo. While it is unclear if any of the students will ever become professional sommeliers  the exposure to the world of wine provided by the classes has been very welcome. “I don’t even drink  but I’ve learned to sip it  smell it and taste it ” said one inmate  who is serving a   sentence and who was granted an exception to speak anonymously. “You can think it’s a small thing 1.0 "In the first episode of “One Day at a Time ” Netflix’s reboot of the   Norman Lear sitcom  Penelope (Justina Machado) has an argument with her    son  Alex (Marcel Ruiz) who wants an expensive new pair of sneakers. “Mom ” he says  “I know we’re not rich. But are we poor?” It’s a casual line that sets up a joke. (Penelope reminds Alex that they have a TV  a refrigerator and a laptop. “Those are things poor people have!” he says.) But it’s based on an acknowledgment you don’t really hear in prime time anymore: that there is a class divide  nebulous but real  and that your family is closer to the bad side of it. The new “One Day at a Time ” arriving on Friday  is lively and full of voice  a rare reboot that’s better than the original. It’s a throwback in the best sense  to an era of mainstream  socially engaged   sitcoms. And just as the political debate has pitted diversity against class in a   contest  it’s a reminder that the two aren’t mutually exclusive. In the 1970s  TV was full of characters living paycheck to paycheck  whether cabbies (“Taxi”) waitresses (“Alice”) auto mechanics (“Chico and the Man”) or brewery workers (“Laverne and Shirley”). Mr. Lear  the sitcom maestro of the era  produced a suite of shows like this: “All in the Family ” “Good Times ” “Sanford and Son. ” Mr. Lear  an   populist liberal  made   TV about the little guy. In part  the programming reflected the economy of the time. The average American wage peaked in 1973  and the middle class was broader. But  as income inequality began to grow in the 1980s and ’90s  TV  like any neighborhood buffeted by market forces  got gentrified. Advertising rates became increasingly tied to audience demographics  which made poorer viewers less valuable. Basic cable fragmented the viewership  —   more shows  made for smaller niches  —   and premium networks like HBO focused on series about the kind of people who could afford to pay for networks like HBO. TV courted upscale audiences by showing them versions of themselves. Goodbye  Roseanne Conner hello  Carrie Bradshaw. With few exceptions (like ABC’s “The Middle”) sitcoms moved into offices  cafes and living rooms populated by comfortably   characters. (A recent “ ” slyly acknowledged this remove its affluent parents were mortified when their youngest son took an aptitude test that pegged him as a future “skilled laborer. ”) Work  —   nonprofessional      work  —   became the stuff of   reality TV (“Deadliest Catch”). Just as actual labor became increasingly invisible to consumers  shunted off overseas or hidden through     people entered TV through the poor door  or not at all. With “One Day at a Time”  —   like “Fuller House” and “Gilmore Girls ” another product of Netflix’s drive to exhume our every nostalgic memory  —   peak TV is restoring something of what peak TV took away: the kind of family that buys discounted meat at the grocery store and whose old car stalls when you turn on the  . The original “One Day at a Time ” based on the   Whitney Blake’s experience as a divorced mother  was lighter and more disposable than “All in the Family. ” (I still have warm memories of Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli duetting on “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart ” but let’s not kid ourselves.) But it spoke to the times. Compared with Mr. Lear’s outspoken Maude  Ann Romano (Bonnie Franklin) expressed her feminism practically  —   bouncing from job to job  getting the rent paid and raising two independent girls. (This was in 1975  just five years after it was deemed too outrageous to have Mary Richards be divorced in “The Mary Tyler Moore Show. ”) The update  which Mr. Lear produces with Gloria Calderón Kellett and Mike Royce  moves the setting from Indianapolis to Echo Park  Los Angeles  and reimagines the family as  . (Mr. Lear’s   remake of his own work recalls how he adapted the British “Steptoe and Son” as “Sanford and Son ” with an   cast.) Gloria Estefan reprises the theme song  now syncopated. There’s a   third generation: a   Rita Moreno as Penelope’s   mother  Lydia. The    daughter  Elena (Isabella Gomez  a charmer) is a school debate champ who sees her coming quinceañera as a tool of the patriarchy. The omnipresent apartment super  Schneider (Todd Grinnell)  —   played in the original by Pat Harrington  with a mustache that defined ’70s    —   is now a stubbly   hipster whose dad owns the building. The most productive rethinking involves Penelope  a veteran of Afghanistan who works as a medical assistant. The war ended her marriage  —   she separated from her husband  also a soldier  who developed a drinking problem from stress  —   and left her with anxiety and a bum shoulder. The show understands  in a way comedies about more privileged families don’t have to  that circumstances shape choices and exact costs. Despite the   laughs  the series works best in   dramedy mode. The season has a serial arc  and Ms. Machado (previously of “Six Feet Under”) handles the emotional material with a light touch. One of the strongest episodes is built around a long  frustrating phone call with the Department of Veterans Affairs as Penelope tries to wrangle a chiropractor referral. The   humor is clunkier. Stephen Tobolowsky carries some familiar workplace subplots as Penelope’s   boss  and the show leans heavily on Ricky   jokes about Lydia’s accent. Still  if the comedy can be dated  the retro approach  —   multicamera  theatrical     —   feels current  as the headlines recall the tumult of the ’70s and the   seems to be tweeting from Archie Bunker’s armchair. (One of the season’s themes  immigration  lands harder  if differently  from the way it might have before the election.) Of course  one sitcom can represent only so much. Scripted TV still neglects   rural America  though Netflix has lately stepped into that gap with “The Ranch. ” NBC’s affable workplace sitcom “Superstore” speaks to an economy that  campaign rhetoric aside  is more about service and retail jobs than about assembly lines. Maybe they’ll have company soon: ABC  for instance  is talking about making its programming more    after the election. If efforts like this manage to find us the next “Roseanne ” that’s all good. But the new “One Day at a Time ” which arrives while Hispanic TV families are still a rarity  also casually refutes the lazy postelection punditry that “ ” is a euphemism for “white ” that there is an   choice between the “identity politics” of representing the underrepresented and a   focus on people’s economic struggles. If TV can help divided Americans see one another better  it’s by telling more specific stories of every kind. It’s true that we don’t see enough   people on TV  or military veterans or Hispanic families. And guess what? Sometimes  this “One Day at a Time” reminds us "Your forthcoming book  “Tears We Cannot Stop ” is subtitled “A Sermon to White America. ” Which part of white America do you envision reading it? I envision the audience to be that ocean of white folk I encounter who are deeply empathetic to the struggles of minorities  —   they are the ones who ask me  “What can I do  as a white person?” This is my attempt to address them in the most useful and  hopefully  edifying manner. What’s your strategy for getting through to the white people who may not be particularly sympathetic? What I’ve seen under the wonderful presidency of Barack Obama is the tendency to not tell white people the truth  for obvious reasons  —   they don’t vote for you. But I’m not a politician. I don’t have that power or influence  but what I do wield is a different kind of bully pulpit. We have to have enough belief in white people to tell them the truth. They are grown! There are a lot of areas within race relations that seem like less of a conversation and more of an attempt to prove to white people that these issues  —   police brutality  for instance  —   are a real and present danger. I open this book with horror stories about my engagement with the police. These are the stories that have shaped me  that join me to the mass of people who  regardless of our station in life  regardless of educational attainment and achievement  have felt this. The president of the United States has these stories  the former attorney general has these stories and a prominent black intellectual like me has these stories. The reality is that this is part and parcel of what it means to be black in America  and I wanted to spend time talking and thinking about it from a number of different perspectives to show white brothers and sisters that we aren’t making this up. This is not fabricated. I can’t help but think that if the same levels of police brutality were happening to white people  we would just disband the police. Police brutality would not be seen as the price of keeping our society safe. Recently  I was outside of Ben’s Chili Bowl in Washington at 3 a. m. and a young white kid is cursing the police  and I’m going  “Oh  my God  they’re going to shoot him. ” And then it occurred to me that they wouldn’t  —   he’s a white kid. And what did I hear the police say? “Now  son  you’re clearly inebriated. You need to go home and sleep this off. ” And I said to myself: “My God! This is what we want!” We can’t even afford a display of anger that many white people have. At the end of your sermon  you do a “benediction” section  in which you talk about making reparations on the local and individual level: donating to groups like the United Negro College Fund or a scholarship program  but also  to cite your example from the book  paying “the black person who cuts your grass double what you might ordinarily pay. ” That gave me pause! Good! I used to say in church  “If the sermon ain’t making you a little bit uncomfortable  it ain’t effective. ” Look  if it doesn’t cost you anything  you’re not really engaging in change you’re engaging in convenience. You’re engaged in the overflow. I’m asking you to do stuff you wouldn’t ordinarily do. I’m asking you to think more seriously and strategically about why you possess what you possess. I agree with reparations  but maybe this is my white privilege speaking: I can’t imagine actually doing that. That is what I meant by an I. R. A.: an individual reparations account. You ain’t got to ask the government  you don’t have to ask your local politician  —   this is what you  an individual  conscientious  “woke” citizen can do. But charity can’t be the end of it  right? The Koch brothers gave the United Negro College Fund $25 million "Condé Nast Publications might be sitting on a gold mine: its archive of some eight million photographs and illustrations from Vanity Fair  The New Yorker  Vogue  Architectural Digest and other magazines. Now  given the tenuous state of the media industry  the company has plans to exploit it. The archive is housed on the 15th floor of a building not far from Condé Nast’s headquarters at One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. Photographs and magazines  some going back more than 100 years  are stored in plastic slips and stacked in folders or tucked away in cabinets. Down the hall from the main room is a   locker  where original slides and transparencies are cataloged out of harm’s way. Here you will find the first cover of Vogue  from Dec. 17  1892  a sketch of a debutante clad in a ball gown and floating on what appears to be a cloud pillow. And here is a photograph of Coco Chanel lounging on a sofa  taken by the Vogue photographer Horst P. Horst  who died in 1999. Binders stand on metal shelves  packed with transparencies from   runway shows in New York and Paris  a chronicle of shifting necklines  hems and bejeweled bodices. “This is the history of fashion ” said Ivan Shaw  48  the former executive photo director of Vogue  who was named Condé Nast’s photography director for the archive in June. If all goes according to plan  much of this material will soon be the stuff of   prints       coffee mugs  tote bags  pillows and such. Further  the company will invite the   known as influencers to explore the archive  —   videographers in tow  —   to discuss their favorite pieces and grab the interest of their   audiences. Mr. Shaw is part of a team charged with expanding sales of the archival goods. Since his appointment  as a major part of the initiative  he has been readying an online store  to be called Condé Nast Editions. Until recently  the archive team’s priority was preservation. But given the industrywide losses in print advertising  Condé Nast and other media companies are turning to new sources of revenue. “These images have unprecedented value ” said Cathy Hoffman Glosser  who was hired as the company’s senior vice president for licensing in 2015. “And we want these assets to become more accessible. ” Mr. Shaw calls the trove a time machine. “There is a story about every picture from an artist  what he or she has taken ” he said. He mentioned Edward Steichen  who worked for Vogue and Vanity Fair for 15 years beginning in the 1920s. “When I’m holding a photograph by Edward Steichen  for that moment  I am there. ” One of the photographers whose work has gained new attention since the opening of the archive is Horst  a favorite of Mr. Shaw’s  whose Vogue career flourished under the editor Diana Vreeland in the 1960s. In October  Condé Nast published a Horst volume  “Around That Time: Horst at Home in Vogue ” edited by Hamish Bowles. In addition to producing the book  Mr. Shaw curated exhibitions of Horst’s work at SOCO Gallery in Charlotte  N. C. and Venus Over Los Angeles in California. Others of note whose work sits in the archive and may soon be available to the wider world include Arthur Elgort  Robert Frank  George   Herbert Matter  Helmut Newton  Irving Penn  John Rawlings and Bert Stern  and the illustrators Miguel Covarrubias and Bob Staake. Condé Nast is not free to make commercial use of all its artists’ works  however Annie Leibovitz  who shoots for Vanity Fair and Vogue  owns the rights to her photographs. In a   of the archive’s appeal  Paddle8 recently offered three limited editions of The New Yorker’s May 2  2016  “Purple Rain” cover illustration  a tribute to Prince by the artist Bob Staake  for $2  700 apiece. (One has sold thus far.) Buyers with lighter wallets paid $95 for prints of the same cover at The New Yorker online store (189 were sold  Mr. Shaw said) or $325 for a signed    version of the magazine cover (fans bought 121 of those). Mr. Shaw said he had two exhibitions and book projects in development on 1970s fashion photography  drawing on Vogue’s library  and a documentary in the works on Mr. Elgort  76  the   Vogue photographer. Camilla Nickerson  a fashion editor at Vogue who worked with Mr. Shaw  said  “He has had to deal with a lot personalities and egos and he is good at being able to cope with their enormous needs. ” But Mr. Shaw seems most interested in the images themselves. While flipping through a 1957 copy of Architectural Digest  he lingered over a picture by Julius Shulman  whose photographs of Southern California architecture captured midcentury style. “You really feel like what the room would be like ” Mr. Shaw said 1.0 "WASHINGTON  —   A united front of top intelligence officials and senators from both parties on Thursday forcefully reaffirmed the conclusion that the Russian government used hacking and leaks to try to influence the presidential election  directly rebuffing   Donald J. Trump’s repeated questioning of Russia’s role. They suggested that the doubts Mr. Trump has expressed on Twitter about the agencies’ competence and impartiality were undermining their morale. “There’s a difference between skepticism and disparagement ” James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence  said at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the Russian hacks. He added that “our assessment now is even more resolute” that the Russians carried out the attack on the election. The Senate hearing was the prelude to an extraordinary meeting scheduled for Friday  when Mr. Clapper and other intelligence chiefs will repeat for Mr. Trump the same detailed  highly classified briefing on the Russian attack that President Obama received on Thursday. In effect  they will be telling the   that the spy agencies believe he won with an assist from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Then Mr. Trump will have to say whether he accepts the agencies’ basic findings on Russia’s role or holds to his previous contention that inept  politicized American spies have gotten the perpetrator of the hacking wrong. That would throw the intelligence agencies into a crisis of credibility and status with few  if any  precedents. In a pair of Twitter posts early Thursday  Mr. Trump appeared to back away from the scorn he had previously expressed for the intelligence agencies’ work  as well as from his embrace of Julian Assange  the founder of WikiLeaks  which released most of the hacked emails of Democratic officials. “The dishonest media likes saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange  —   wrong ” he wrote. “I simply state what he states  it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘Intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!” But on Thursday night  the   returned to Twitter and appeared to underscore his doubts about the F. B. I. ’s investigation of the hacking. “The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia ” he wrote  a day after a report by BuzzFeed on the issue. “So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?” Early next week  the public will get its fullest information to date on the evidence the agencies have to support their contention that Mr. Putin’s government used the hacked emails to hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign and help Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Clapper said he would “push the envelope” to include as much detail as possible in the unclassified version of the intelligence agencies’ report on the Russian operation. The hacking  he added  was only one part of that operation  which also included the dissemination of “classical propaganda  disinformation  fake news. ” Mr. Clapper will step down as intelligence director later this month after a career in intelligence and military service that began when he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1961. His replacement is expected to be Dan Coats  a retired senator from Indiana  a Trump transition official said Thursday. A   conservative who served on the Senate Intelligence Committee  Mr. Coats would oversee the nation’s 16 intelligence agencies in a job that was created after the Sept. 11  2001  terrorist attacks to improve the sharing of information  but that is sometimes criticized as adding a layer of bureaucracy. The Coats news came on the same day that R. James Woolsey  a former C. I. A. director  stepped down as a senior adviser to Mr. Trump  citing his diminishing role in the transition. The Senate hearing on Thursday  devoted to foreign cyberthreats  was unusual as much for its context as its content  —   a public  bipartisan display of support for the intelligence community that seemed aimed  at times  at an audience of one. Though Mr. Clapper and most Republican senators were careful to avoid antagonizing the   directly  the hearing spoke to the rift Mr. Trump has threatened to create between the incoming administration and the intelligence officials assigned to inform it. Senator John McCain  Republican of Arizona and chairman of the committee  said the purpose of the gathering was “not to question the outcome of the presidential election” but to move forward with a full understanding of what had happened. Repeatedly  though  Mr. McCain and his colleagues seemed to undercut Mr. Trump’s past messages of support for Russia  and for Mr. Assange of WikiLeaks. “Do you think there’s any credibility we should attach to this individual?” Mr. McCain asked. “Not in my view ” Mr. Clapper said. Another witness at the hearing  Adm. Michael S. Rogers  the head of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command  said he agreed. The intelligence director said he welcomed skeptical questioning from Mr. Trump  allowing that the intelligence community was “not perfect. ” “We are an organization of human beings  and we’re prone  sometimes  to make errors ” Mr. Clapper said. But he said the agencies had learned from their failures  notably their declaration that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Democrats on the committee repeatedly coaxed intelligence leaders to rebut Mr. Trump’s multiple assertions that a random individual hacker might have hacked Democratic targets. Senator Joe Donnelly  Democrat of Indiana  told Mr. Clapper that in the conflict between the intelligence agencies and Mr. Assange over Russian responsibility for the attack  “We’re on your side every time. ” He asked Mr. Clapper to convey his level of confidence in attributing the election attack to Russia  rather than “someone in his basement. ” “It’s  uh  very high ” the laconic intelligence director replied. At one point  Senator Claire McCaskill  Democrat of Missouri  wondered aloud “who benefits from a   trashing the intelligence community. ” Ms. McCaskill said there would be “howls from the Republican side of the aisle” if a Democrat had spoken about intelligence officials as Mr. Trump had. Senator Tim Kaine  Democrat of Virginia and Mrs. Clinton’s running mate  used the occasion for an aside about Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn  Mr. Trump’s choice for national security adviser  who has a history of sharing discredited news stories and conspiracy theories. Mr. Kaine said that he was unsure whether Mr. Flynn was acting out of “gullibility” or “malice ” but that it was a cause for “great concern” that Mr. Flynn shared stories that “most fourth graders would find incredible. ” No Republican lawmakers embraced Mr. Trump’s remarks casting doubt on the intelligence conclusions  though some were more conspicuous than others in their efforts to distance themselves. Perhaps the closest to a defense of Mr. Trump came from Senator Tom Cotton  Republican of Arkansas. Denouncing “imprecise language” stating that Russia “hacked the election ” Mr. Cotton asked Mr. Clapper to confirm that the actual balloting was not affected. Mr. Cotton also suggested that the conventional wisdom that Mr. Putin favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton might be wrong. Mr. Trump promised a stronger military and more American oil and gas production  —   policies Mr. Cotton suggested would not be to Russia’s advantage. Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina  criticized the Obama administration for its response to the Russian attack. He said the White House had lobbed mere “pebbles” in retaliation for the interference. “When it comes to interfering with our election  we better be ready to throw rocks
