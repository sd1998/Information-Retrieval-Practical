"WASHINGTON  —   Republicans hope to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act using an expedited procedure known as budget reconciliation. The process is sometimes called arcane  but it has been used often in the past 35 years to write some of the nation’s most important laws. “Reconciliation is probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to Congress for a large portion of the budget ” the Congressional Research Service  a nonpartisan arm of Congress  has said. Here is a primer. Q. What is the budget reconciliation process? A. It is a way for Congress to speed action on legislation that changes taxes or spending  especially spending for entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Although conceived primarily as a way to reduce federal budget deficits  it has also been used to cut taxes and to create programs that increase spending  —   changes that can raise deficits. In the Senate  a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority. For other bills  a   majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote. Q. Why is it called reconciliation? A. The term originated in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974  which was intended to give Congress more control over the budget process by allowing lawmakers to set overall levels of spending and revenue. The process begins with a budget blueprint  a resolution that guides Congress but is not presented to the president for a signature or veto. It recommends federal revenue  deficit  debt and spending levels in areas like defense  energy  education and health care. The resolution may direct one or more committees to develop legislation to achieve specified budgetary results. By adopting these proposals  Congress can change existing laws so that actual revenue and spending are brought into line with  —   reconciled with  —   policies in the budget resolution. Q. How has reconciliation been used? A. Since 1980  Congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills. Twenty became law. Four were vetoed. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the “Reagan revolution. ” It squeezed savings out of Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  food stamps  the school lunch program  farm subsidies  student loans  welfare and jobless benefits  among many other programs. In 1996  Congress reversed six decades of social welfare policy  eliminating the individual entitlement to cash assistance for the nation’s poorest children and giving each state a lump sum of federal money with vast discretion over its use. Those changes were made in a reconciliation bill  pushed by Republicans but signed by President Bill Clinton. Congress reduced deficits with another reconciliation bill  the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That law also created the Children’s Health Insurance Program  primarily for uninsured children in   families. On the same day in 1997  Mr. Clinton signed a separate reconciliation bill that cut taxes. The Bush tax cuts were adopted in reconciliation bills signed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003. On several occasions  Congress has increased assistance to   working families by increasing the   tax credit in reconciliation bills. Congress also made changes to the Affordable Care Act in a reconciliation bill passed immediately after President Obama signed the health care overhaul in 2010. Later  when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress  they passed a reconciliation bill to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act  but Mr. Obama vetoed the bill in January 2016. Republicans say that measure will provide a template or starting point for their efforts to undo the health care law this year  with support from   Donald J. Trump  who calls the law “an absolute disaster. ” Q. How does the reconciliation process work in the Senate? A. In the House  leaders of the majority party can usually control what happens if their members stick together. In the Senate  by contrast  one member or a handful of senators can often derail the leaders’ plans. The reconciliation process enhances the power of the majority party and its leaders. Senate debate on a reconciliation bill is normally limited to 20 hours  so it cannot be filibustered on the Senate floor. The Senate has a special rule to prevent abuse of the budget reconciliation process. The rule  named for former Senator Robert C. Byrd  Democrat of West Virginia  generally bars use of the procedure to consider legislation that has no effect on spending  taxes and deficits. The Senate parliamentarian normally decides whether particular provisions violate the Byrd rule  but the Senate can waive the rule with a   majority. Q. What does this mean for the Affordable Care Act? A. Republicans hope to use the   procedure of budget reconciliation to repeal or nullify provisions of the law that affect spending and taxes. They could  for example  eliminate penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees. They could use a reconciliation bill to eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid. And they could use it to repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges. Republicans could also repeal a number of taxes and fees imposed on certain   people and on health insurers and manufacturers of   prescription drugs and medical devices: tax increases that help offset the cost of the insurance coverage expansions. Those provisions were all rolled back in the reconciliation bill Mr. Obama vetoed last January. That bill did not touch insurance market standards established in the Affordable Care Act  which do not directly cost the government money or raise taxes. The standards stipulate  for example  that insurers cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a person’s   conditions. Insurers must allow parents to keep children on their policies until the age of 26  and they cannot charge women higher rates than men  as they often did in the past. Such provisions are politically popular  but it is not clear how they could remain in force without the coverage expansions that help insurers afford such regulations. Without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance  and without subsidies  supporters of the health law say many healthy people would go without coverage  knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it. Democrats say they will fight to preserve the law after Mr. Obama leaves office. Recent history shows that lobbying and public pressure can sometimes make a difference 1.0 "WASHINGTON  —   Majorities in Congress often overreach  but usually not on the very first day. House Republicans  on the verge of a Washington takeover as the new Congress convened Tuesday  couldn’t stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business. In the process  they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an   celebration of unified Republican government  undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come. House Republicans take a stand on a contentious issue  Donald J. Trump turns to Twitter to break with House Republicans  then Republicans frantically reverse course. “Mr. Trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp  and here we are on Day 1 trying to fill the swamp ” Representative Walter B. Jones  Republican of North Carolina  said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers. “That is not a good way to start. ” Deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines  chagrined Republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted Monday night in a   party meeting before Mr. Trump weighed in via Twitter and suggested that the overhaul shouldn’t be a top priority  urging Republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care. But the final decision did come after the  ’s Twitter posts  underscoring his sway over House Republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the majority leader. House Republicans might have amusedly applauded Mr. Trump’s cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes  but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way  raising alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. Following the decision to reverse course  several lawmakers were quietly fretting that Mr. Trump’s megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized. Other Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill were wondering how the   proposal got as far as it did  given the stated reservations of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy among others. They said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter  demonstrating once again how hard it can be to manage the House Republicans even when the party is set to control both Capitol Hill and the White House. Mr. Ryan had already headed off an earlier rules change that was deemed potentially embarrassing: a proposal to let lawmakers resume funding of pet projects through designated “earmarks” as long as the money went to public entities. Abuse of earmarks was one of the main sources of congressional corruption that led to tighter ethics rules and a ban on such spending  and Mr. Ryan and his allies believed that a quick move to restore them so soon after Mr. Trump’s election would not send the proper signal. But Mr. Ryan has promised to revisit both the earmark issue and the revisions to the Office of Congressional Ethics later this year. The ethics office was created in 2008 at the urging of Representative Nancy Pelosi  the California Democrat who was then the House speaker. This was in response to criticism that the Select Committee on Ethics  comprising lawmakers from both parties  was ineffective  given a string of   corruption cases and other breakdowns such as a scandal involving teenage House pages. Lawmakers from both parties were against the office then  as well as now  and would much prefer to be judged by their peers  —   politicians currently serving in the House who might be more sympathetic  —   as opposed to a more discrete board and staff. But in moving ahead with the rules change on a strictly partisan basis  Republicans opened the door to Democrats berating them for the proposal  even though a significant number of Democrats are just as unhappy with the ethics office. It was similar to a move House Republicans made in 2005 when they used the   rules package to weaken the ethics committee itself after a series of rebukes against Tom DeLay  the majority leader. That decision sparked an outcry from Democrats and watchdog groups that helped Democrats regain the majority the next year with a message that Republicans were fostering a culture of corruption. “I think it is always better to do changes to the ethics process in a bipartisan manner ” said John Feehery  a former top Republican aide in the House. “It protects you from political attacks. ” The tussle over the ethics office is just one illustration of how Mr. Trump and his outsider ideas could clash with his own party in Congress. Mr. Trump has vowed to move forward with a proposal to impose term limits on Congress  and many in the party are not happy with that idea. Other sources of friction are bound to emerge  given his campaign message about shaking up Washington. “I just could not believe that the Congress does not understand that  if anything  we need to bring sunshine in "WASHINGTON  —   Ivanka Trump  who is weighing a prominent role in her father’s administration  is planning to move with her family to a mansion in the exclusive Kalorama section of Washington  two people familiar with the decision said Wednesday. The house was previously owned by a   financier with extensive investments in Russia and ties to a Russian opposition leader. Ms. Trump and her husband  Jared Kushner  a close adviser to   Donald J. Trump who is expected to be an influential voice in the administration  have chosen a      house just around the corner from President Obama’s new home. The newly renovated house  with its sleekly modern décor  sold for $5. 5 million in December  the people said  insisting on anonymity because the transaction was private. The home was previously owned by Dan K. Rapoport and his wife  Irina  according to property records filed with the District of Columbia. Neither responded to emailed requests for comment. Ms. Trump’s relocation plans  first reported by Washingtonian magazine  are the latest evidence that she and Mr. Kushner will remain major players in Mr. Trump’s administration. Both played crucial roles in his presidential bid and have wielded outsize power during his transition. People close to the couple declined to comment on their impending move  as did William F. X. Moody  a   at Washington Fine Properties  who first disclosed the deal. But in the neighborhood where they are planning to live  —     of ambassadors and prominent figures on the Washington social circuit  —   residents have been buzzing about their    neighbors. “Everybody’s atwitter about it ” said Tony Podesta  chairman of the Podesta Group  a top Washington lobbying firm. “I’ve been getting lots of emails saying  ‘Here we go again ’ ” Mr. Podesta said  alluding to the burst of local mayhem that attended the decision by Mr. Obama and his family to rent a   home in the neighborhood after they leave the White House. “It will be great to have them as neighbors ” Mr. Podesta said of Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner  who have three children. The white house on Tracy Place where Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner plan to live with their children is just around the corner from the Obamas’ luxurious   home on Belmont Road  which has been undergoing extensive renovations directed by the Secret Service to fortify it for their arrival. A security checkpoint is expected to be built at the intersection of Tracy and Belmont before Mr. Obama moves in  residents said. There was no sign of Ms. Trump or her husband at the house on Wednesday afternoon. But the property was a flurry of activity  as workers and painters filed in and out past television reporters staked out on the sidewalk and   speculated about their new neighbors. John Damgard  who has owned a house on the block since 1971  said his new neighbors could expect to be welcomed “with open arms ” even by the neighborhood’s Democrats. “It’s quiet  it’s private  and they’ll be graciously received ” Mr. Damgard said. The house was home for several decades to Renee Zlotnick Kraft  a Washington fur heiress and socialite  who frequently opened its doors for events and even occasionally rolled out a pink carpet to welcome the city’s dinner party set. According to the website of his investment firm  Rapoport Capital  Mr. Rapoport was born in Riga  Latvia  and has lived in the United States  France and Russia. Vladimir Ashurkov  a top aide to Aleksei A. Navalny  a leading Russian opposition leader and critic of the Russian president  Vladimir V. Putin  described Mr. Rapoport as a successful financier in Moscow and an investor in Soho Rooms  one of the city’s poshest nightclubs. He has also been a supporter of Mr. Navalny since 2010. He recently relocated from Washington to Kiev  Ukraine  where he manages a private equity fund  Mr. Ashurkov said. It was not clear whether Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner bought the house from the Rapoports or would be renting it from a new owner. But after scouting locations in other exclusive neighborhoods  including nearby Georgetown "The Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles  nor is he well known in corporate America. He is the insider’s insider  —   a deal maker. As such  his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. In contrast  the agency’s two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds. Mr. Clayton  known as Jay  has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms. His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities. He had a   seat to the financial crisis  advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings  including the biggest ever  the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013. If Mr. Clayton is confirmed  he may have to recuse himself from some matters. A similar scrutiny was applied to Mary Jo White  the agency’s current chairwoman. She had been a litigator at Debevoise  Plimpton  where her clients included JPMorgan Chase  Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation and Kenneth D. Lewis  a former Bank of America chief executive. Still  such recusals are not unusual. Laura S. Unger  a former commissioner and acting chairwoman  said that during her tenure  she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission. She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission’s ethics officer. “An ethics officer at the S. E. C. knows all of your intimate details  and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts ” she noted. Yet Mr. Clayton’s nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs could wield too much influence in the Trump administration. Sullivan  Cromwell  where Mr. Clayton is a partner  has been Goldman’s   law firm for more than a century. Mr. Clayton advised Goldman Sachs on perhaps its most important deal  the $5 billion investment by Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway amid the financial crisis. Mr. Clayton’s wife works as a   adviser at Goldman. The S. E. C. nomination follows the appointment of Goldman’s No. 2 executive  Gary D. Cohn  to be the top economic policy adviser to   Donald J. Trump  and the selection of a hedge fund manager who was a former Goldman trader  Steven T. Mnuchin  to be Treasury secretary. Mr. Trump’s chief strategist  Stephen K. Bannon  is a former Goldman banker. During the presidential campaign  Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized Goldman Sachs as an emblem of a financial elite. Mr. Trump  who met with Mr. Clayton on Dec. 22  said in a statement that the lawyer “will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time. ” Mr. Clayton is expected to face scrutiny on his confirmation as a Sullivan  Cromwell colleague  H. Rodgin Cohen  did in 2009. Mr. Cohen  the dean of Wall Street lawyers  withdrew his name from consideration for a senior Treasury role amid an outcry over his deep involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep   Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder ’” Senator Sherrod Brown  Democrat of Ohio  said. “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited  demand real accountability from financial institutions the S. E. C. oversees and work to prevent another financial crisis. ” One issue could be Mr. Clayton’s representation of Alibaba. The Chinese   giant is under investigation by the S. E. C. over its accounting practices. Mr. Clayton also represented   Capital Management in its $1. 2 billion initial public offering a decade ago  and subsequent offerings and financing. A unit of the New   hedge fund pleaded guilty for what federal prosecutors said were more than $100 million in bribes paid to officials in African countries. The hedge fund was forced to pay a $400 million settlement. Government authorities said in September that they were still investigating individuals related to case. Another issue could be a 2011 report critical of the government’s enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  which argued that “the current   regime” was “causing lasting harm to the competitiveness of U. S. regulated companies and the U. S. capital markets. ” Mr. Clayton was the chairman of the New York City bar association committee that drafted the report. Requests to speak with Mr. Clayton at Sullivan  Cromwell were not answered. A number of fellow deal lawyers said they were glad that the    practitioner could be at the helm of the S. E. C. “He’s a very smart  pragmatic guy who has real deal experience and has seen this stuff firsthand ” said Richard Truesdell  a head of Davis Polk’s global capital markets group  who has worked with Mr. Clayton on several deals. “There’s been a lot of buzz today  and I have yet to talk to anyone who isn’t pleasantly surprised by the choice. ” The role of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors and enable companies to raise capital through the public markets in a way that fosters economic growth. The latter is a key tenet of Mr. Trump’s economic plan  with the aim that companies can use the excess capital to create jobs. Harvey Pitt  a former chairman of the S. E. C. appointed by President George W. Bush  said Mr. Clayton was a “  appointment. ” “It is especially logical with respect to the agency’s obligation to promote capital formation  a subject with which the incoming administration is appropriately concerned ” said Mr. Pitt in an email. “Mr. Clayton’s background is very impressive  —   both for the depth of his experience  and for the quality of his efforts. ” Mr. Clayton went to the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cambridge for separate bachelor’s degrees and then obtained his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Mr. Clayton donated to Mitt Romney and Mr. Obama in previous presidential elections and to Jeb Bush’s primary campaign in 2015  according to public records. Those who know Mr. Clayton describe him as the     type  a doer who is often in the shadows of the better known Mr. Cohen at Sullivan  Cromwell. “When I think about the position  the guy has a really deep understanding of the capital markets and financial regulatory matters  so he checks those boxes ” said Brad Whitman  vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley 2017.0 1.0 "CHARLESTON  S. C.  —   Seeming to abdicate one of his last chances to save his own life  the convicted killer Dylann S. Roof stood on Wednesday before the jurors who will decide his fate and offered no apology  no explanation and no remorse for massacring nine black churchgoers during a Bible study session in June 2015. Instead  in a strikingly brief opening statement in the sentencing phase of his federal death penalty trial  Mr. Roof repeatedly assured the jury that he was not mentally ill  —   undercutting one of the few mitigating factors that could work in his favor  —   and left it at that. “Other than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn’t and the fact that I’m probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who’s ever existed  there’s nothing wrong with me psychologically ” Mr. Roof  who is representing himself  told the jury  which found him guilty last month of the killings at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Three minutes after walking to the lectern  Mr. Roof returned to the defense table  exhaling deeply. Any prospects for mercy by the jury had perhaps already been drained by the prosecution’s disclosure  in its opening statement  of a white supremacist manifesto written by Mr. Roof in the Charleston County jail sometime in the six weeks after his arrest. “I would like to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did ” he wrote in his distinctive scrawl. “I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. ” Mr. Roof  who was then 21  continued: “I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country and I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race. I have shed a tear of   for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place. I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed. ” As the government laid out its case for a death sentence  the prosecutor who read from the journal  Nathan S. Williams  an assistant United States attorney  told the jury of 10 women and two men that Mr. Roof’s deadly rampage was a premeditated act that had devastated the families of his victims. “The defendant didn’t stop after shooting one person or two or four or five he killed nine people ” Mr. Williams said  a few moments before he declared  “The death penalty is justified. ” Later  aided by a slide show  he described each of the victims and their lives  setting the stage for several days of   testimony by family members and friends of the victims. Mr. Williams emphasized that Mr. Roof was capable of remorse and regret  reminding jurors that he had left his mother a note of apology  but only for the pain he knew his actions would cause his own family. The presentations were a startling beginning to the trial’s sentencing phase  which is expected to run into next week in Federal District Court. On Dec. 15  after six days of testimony in which defense lawyers did not contest his guilt  the jury found Mr. Roof guilty of 33 counts  including hate crimes  obstruction of religion resulting in death  and firearms charges. Eighteen of those counts require the jury to decide whether to sentence Mr. Roof  now 22  to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. To impose a death sentence  jurors must unanimously find that aggravating factors like premeditation and the number and vulnerability of the victims outweigh any mitigating factors  like the absence of prior violent behavior and demonstrations of redemption and remorse. Mr. Roof is also facing a death penalty trial in state court. Although many people in the courtroom had already heard Mr. Roof’s flat    monotone during the guilt phase  when prosecutors played a video recording of his   confession to F. B. I. agents  his statement on Wednesday was his first to the jury. Mr. Roof chose to allow his   legal team to represent him during the guilt phase  but sidelined them during the penalty proceedings to prevent them from introducing any evidence regarding his family background or mental capacity. “The point is that I’m not going to lie to you  not by myself or through somebody else ” Mr. Roof told the jury. As his paternal grandparents watched from the second row on the left side of the courtroom  several women on the right side  which is reserved for victims’ family members  left their seats  one of them muttering curses. Mr. Roof has said he does not plan to call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf  and he did not   any of the prosecution’s witnesses on Wednesday. His approach stands in sharp contrast to the strategy of Justice Department lawyers  who have said they may call more than 30 witnesses  including at least one survivor of the attack  family members of the victims and federal law enforcement officials. Prosecutors began Wednesday with the widow of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney  the church’s slain pastor  and his two best friends. Jennifer Benjamin Pinckney  who was married to Mr. Pinckney for 15 years  narrated an affectionate and often lighthearted telling of their life together  illustrated by dozens of photographs of her husband  —   as a young saxophone player in a school band  attending the births of their two daughters  vacationing on Caribbean cruises and on a trip to Seattle. She described him as a   preacher who extended his ministry as “a voice for the voiceless” to his work in the South Carolina Legislature  where he served first in the House and then the Senate. Often exhausted by his dual roles  he was depicted in several pictures as having fallen asleep in the back seat of the family car and on a couch while reading to his daughters. “He was the person that I think every mom would be happy that her daughter would marry ” Ms. Pinckney  a school librarian  said. “He was that great catch. ” Ms. Pinckney also described her terror on the night of June 17  2015  as she and the couple’s younger daughter  Malana  then 6  listened to the gunfire from their hiding place beneath a desk in her husband’s study. As her husband and the others were gunned down in the adjacent church fellowship hall  Ms. Pinckney struggled to keep her daughter quiet and still. “I was just like  ‘Shh  shh  shh ’ ” Ms. Pinckney said  “and I put my hand over her mouth  and she was holding on to me  and she put her hand on my mouth. ” “Mama  is Daddy going to die?” her daughter asked  Ms. Pinckney said. She said the hardest thing she had ever done was telling her two daughters early the next morning that their father had been killed. Ms. Pinckney said she had heard Mr. Roof try to open the door to the study  which she had locked when the shooting began. Another assistant United States attorney  Julius N. Richardson  asked why she thought she had been spared. “It wasn’t my time ” Ms. Pinckney answered. “I couldn’t see God taking both parents away from two small kids. ” The Rev. Kylon Middleton  an A. M. E. minister who had known Mr. Pinckney from childhood  described his lifelong friend as immensely precocious (he began preaching at 13) and strategically ambitious (he aspired to be both a bishop and  perhaps  the state’s first   governor). In addition to Mr. Pinckney  the victims were the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor  49 Cynthia Hurd  54 Susie Jackson  87 Ethel Lee Lance  70 Tywanza Sanders  26 the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr. 74 the Rev. Sharonda   45 and Myra Thompson  59. Near the end of the day  Ms. Thompson’s widower  the Rev. Anthony B. Thompson  the vicar of a Reformed Episcopal Church here  told jurors about their   marriage  their anniversary date to a beach  his wife’s determined demeanor and her commitment to the historic congregation. In testimony that was mixed with laughter and tears  Mr. Thompson recounted their final day together as she prepared for the evening study of the Gospel of Mark. “She had her glow ” he said. “I mean  this smile on her face. She was radiant. I just kept looking at her. ” Word of a shooting came hours later  and Mr. Thompson rushed to the church. He demanded to know whether she had been injured or killed. He eventually found out. “My whole world was gone ” he said. “I literally did not know what to do. Everything I did was for her  and she was gone. What am I here for? If she’s gone
