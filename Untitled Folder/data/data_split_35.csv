"ISTANBUL  —   The Islamic State on Monday issued a rare claim of responsibility for an attack in Turkey after a New Year’s Day shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people  describing the gunman who carried out the assault  —   and who has not been identified or captured  —   as “a hero soldier of the caliphate. ” The Turkish authorities are still searching for the gunman  who killed a police officer guarding the Reina nightclub before going on a shooting rampage with a   rifle  but the state news media reported that eight suspects had been detained in connection with the attack. The authorities on Monday released two photographs of the person suspected of being the gunman  captured by security cameras  that showed a   cleanshaven man in a dark winter coat. The government’s spokesman  Numan Kurtulmus  said at a news conference that investigators believed they found the assailant’s fingerprints and that they were close to identifying him. Mr. Kurtulmus did not mention the Islamic State specifically  but he said Turkey would press the fight against terrorism. Referring to the attack  which happened just after midnight on Sunday morning  Mr. Kurtulmus said: “The fact that it was done during the first minutes of 2017 gives an important message. The message is  ‘We will go on to menace Turkey in 2017.’ And we say to them  we will break into your caves wherever you are. ” The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on Monday that the gunman might be from Kyrgyzstan or elsewhere in Central Asia. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted Aiymkan Kulukeyeva  a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Kyrgyzstan  as saying  “According to preliminary information  this information is doubtful  but we are checking all the same. ” The Islamic State asserted in a statement that the attack had been carried out “in continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey  the protector of the cross. ” “A hero soldier of the caliphate attacked one of the most famous nightclubs  where Christians celebrated their pagan holiday ” read the statement from the Islamic State  also known as ISIS or ISIL. “They used hand grenades and a machine gun and transformed their celebration to mourning. ” In an apparent reference to Turkey’s role in the conflict in Syria  the statement warned that “the government of Turkey should know that the blood of Muslims  which it is targeting with its planes and its guns  will cause a fire in its home by God’s will. ” The statement did not name the assailant  and it was not clear whether the Islamic State had organized the attack or had merely inspired the gunman. But the shooting came just days after a   State group  the Nashir Media Foundation  published the latest in a series of messages calling for attacks on clubs  markets and movie theaters. The Islamic State’s claim of responsibility came after years of complex relations between the Turkish state and the jihadist group operating across its southern border. Several terrorist attacks in Turkey over the last year have been attributed to the Islamic State  but the militant group rarely claims responsibility for major attacks in the country. A rare exception came in November  when the group claimed to be behind a deadly car bombing in southeastern Turkey. Analysts said that the Islamic State has walked a fine line in Turkey  trying to balance its goal of destabilizing the country without antagonizing the government to the extent that it would crack down heavily. For years  Turkey looked the other way  according to analysts and regional diplomats  as jihadist groups moved fighters and supplies across the border  establishing deep networks in Turkish border towns. Committed to supporting the uprising against President Bashar   of Syria  Turkey felt the jihadists could be managed while they fought with forces loyal to the Syrian government. But that policy ultimately changed  as Turkey worked to secure its borders  under pressure from its allies as it took in millions of Syrian refugees and as terrorist attacks rocked the country. Turkey began a military intervention in northern Syria in August that put its forces on the front lines against Kurdish militants as well as Islamic State fighters. This turned the jihadists decidedly against Turkey  prompting their leaders to call for attacks there. The Turkish military said on Monday that it had struck Islamic State targets in Syria  killing at least 22 militants. American intelligence officials had recently expressed concern about a possible attack in Turkey  warning in a statement on Dec. 22 that extremist groups were “continuing aggressive efforts to conduct attacks throughout Turkey” in areas where American citizens and expatriates lived or visited. That warning came three days after a gunman  described by Turkish officials as a      police officer  assassinated Andrey G. Karlov  the Russian ambassador to Turkey  at an art gallery in the capital  Ankara. The gunman shouted “God is great!” and “Don’t forget Aleppo  don’t forget Syria!” during the attack  which was captured on video. The   Anadolu news agency said that 38 of the 39 people who died in the attack on Sunday had been identified "WASHINGTON  —   President Obama’s advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015: How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. Obama’s longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office? As it happened  the president solved the problem for them. In early August of that year  when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council  he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality. “The fever in this room has finally broken ” the president told the group  according to a person in the meeting. “We’re no longer in   mode. ” What Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day  himself included  thought that the United States  —   after 14 years of war  billions of dollars spent and more than 2  000 American lives lost  —   would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself. At the same time  he added  “the counterterrorism challenges are real. ” As bleak as Afghanistan’s prospects were  the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again. A few weeks later  the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely. It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama. The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan  —   the “good war” to George W. Bush’s “bad war” in Iraq  —   had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch. The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had  through bitter experience  become the commander in chief of a forever war. He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey. “We shouldn’t assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy ” the president said in an interview in September. Now  as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump  a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in foreign conflicts  Afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed  as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech  “that war is sometimes necessary  and war at some level is an expression of human folly. ” More than any other conflict  Afghanistan shaped Mr. Obama’s thinking on the basic questions of war  peace and the use of military power. It is where he discovered his affinity for drones  sharpened his belief in the limits of American intervention  battled his generals and hardened his disdain for unreliable foreign leaders. It reaffirmed his suspicions about sending American troops into foreign conflicts and made him reluctant to use more force in Iraq  Syria  Libya and other war zones. It also chastened him about his own hopes. “When it comes to helping these societies stabilize and create a more secure environment and a better life for their people  we have to understand ” he said in the interview  “that this is a long slog. ” Mr. Obama was a state senator from Illinois in October 2002 when he famously condemned Iraq as a “dumb war. ” But in the same speech he also said  “I don’t oppose all wars. ” He was referring to Afghanistan  which he viewed as a just war to hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. “I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again ” he told the crowd that day in Chicago’s Federal Plaza. By July 2008  as the Democratic nominee for president  Mr. Obama had embraced Afghanistan as a priority over Iraq  —   the “good war ” in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him. Mr. Obama praised the Bush administration’s troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society  but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan. “This is a war that we have to win ” he declared. He promised to send at least two more combat brigades  or roughly 10  000 soldiers  to Afghanistan. The United States was hardly on course for victory. Although there were already close to 50  000 American troops in Afghanistan as Mr. Obama campaigned that summer  the Taliban were gaining momentum. In a bloody debacle  nine American soldiers were killed in what became known as the Battle of Wanat when the Taliban brazenly overran a remote Army outpost in the far eastern province of Nuristan. Adm. Mike Mullen  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  echoed Mr. Obama in calling the situation in the country “precarious and urgent. ” More than 100 Americans would die in Afghanistan by the end of 2008  a larger number than in any other prior year. When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009  he ordered a quick policy review on Afghanistan by a former intelligence analyst  Bruce Riedel. But even before it was completed  he accepted a Pentagon recommendation to send 17  000 additional troops to Afghanistan  bringing the total to nearly 70  000 American troops on the ground. By the fall of 2009  with the Taliban showing increased strength  Mr. Obama’s military commanders  backed by the elders on his war council  including Hillary Clinton  then his secretary of state  were pressing him to go much farther. They urged on him an ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that had helped turn around the war in Iraq  —   a     expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads  bridges  schools and a   government. The strategy  known by its acronym COIN  would require as many as 40  000 additional American men and women in uniform in Afghanistan  his advisers told him. “There was still the afterglow of the surge in Iraq  and the counterinsurgency narrative that had made the military the savior of the Iraq war ” said Vali R. Nasr  a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan. “I don’t believe Obama was in a position to pick a debate with the military on Afghanistan  and to assert what would be his worldview. ” “In many ways  I think  he deferred ” said Mr. Nasr  now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Although Mr. Obama agreed after months of internal debate to send 30  000 additional troops to Afghanistan  he placed a strict timetable on the mission  saying they would have to be withdrawn again  starting in July 2011. His aides later said he felt hijacked by a military that had presented him with a narrow band of options rather than a real choice. Even some former military commanders agreed  saying that the troop deployments were framed in a way that made choosing a smaller number  —   20  000  for example  —   look like a path to certain defeat. “President Obama was asking the military for broad options ” said Karl W. Eikenberry  a retired general who served as the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and was later Mr. Obama’s ambassador to Kabul. But  he said  the military gave Mr. Obama only “variations” on “the more robust counterinsurgency model. ” Mr. Eikenberry  who wrote a politically explosive but prescient cable in late 2009 raising doubts about the wisdom of the surge  diagnosed a deeper problem with the policy. Was it simply to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for Al Qaeda? Or was it to turn Afghanistan into another Denmark? “When he came in  everyone knew we were going to do more ” Mr. Eikenberry said. “But what we were trying to achieve was difficult to define. ” Given Mr. Obama’s innate wariness of   it didn’t take long for him to grow disenchanted with the Denmark option. A few months into the surge  in the spring of 2010  David H. Petraeus  the commander of the Pentagon’s Central Command and an architect of the strategy  was briefing him on the state of the counterinsurgency campaign. Drawing on anthropology theory from the University of Chicago  General Petraeus explained to his commander in chief how neighborhoods in Kandahar related to one another. Mr. Obama listened for a while  then cut him off. “We can’t worry about how neighborhoods relate to each other in Kandahar ” he curtly told General Petraeus  according to people in the room. “Obama believes the military can do enormous things ” said Benjamin J. Rhodes  the deputy national security adviser. “It can win wars and stabilize conflicts. But a military can’t create a political culture or build a society. ” By the end of his first term  Mr. Obama had evolved to the point that he fully embraced the concept “Afghan good enough. ” The phrase  which had been kicked around the White House since 2010  referred to the shift away from   to a policy that was content with taking out the terrorists  preventing the Taliban from overrunning the country and putting a premium on getting the troops out. By that new standard  things had improved in Afghanistan. By August 2010  100  000 American troops were on the ground in Afghanistan and were pushing back the Taliban in some critical areas. Despite uneven progress in the military campaign  Ryan Crocker  a diplomat who had reopened the American Embassy in Kabul in 2002 and served there again as ambassador in 2011  recalled thinking  “Wow  this place looks great!” The Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011 added to Mr. Obama’s conviction that he was on the way to closing the books on the war. At midnight on May 1  2012  Air Force One rolled out from behind a hangar at Joint Base Andrews to pick up the president for a secret trip to Afghanistan. He was going to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that set the terms for relations after 2014  when the United States was scheduled to withdraw its combat troops and turn over Afghanistan’s security to the Afghans. Aides to Mr. Obama had advised him not to go for security reasons  but he saw it as an important milestone. The agreement promised an “enduring partnership” between the United States and Afghanistan  with pledges of American help in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions. Yet the promises obscured a starker reality: Mr. Obama had accelerated the timetable for drawing down American troops  and he was looking beyond the war. Speaking to a national TV audience from Bagram Air Base  he suggested that America’s experience in Afghanistan had come full circle. “One year ago  from a base here in Afghanistan  our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden ” he said. “The goal I set  —   to defeat Al Qaeda  and deny it a chance to rebuild  —   is now within our reach. ” Earlier  Mr. Obama had met for an hour with Mr. Karzai. The two had long had a rocky relationship  —   on an earlier trip  Mr. Obama excoriated Mr. Karzai for the rampant corruption in the Afghan government  —   and this session did little to improve their rapport. Mr. Crocker recalled that the president was “very aloof  almost cold  which bothered me a bit because I’d worked a solid damn year to get Karzai in a better place with us. ” Things never warmed up between them. When Mr. Karzai refused to sign a   security agreement with Washington  Mr. Obama gave up on him to focus on his successor  Ashraf Ghani. The experience left a lasting imprint on the president  his aides said. He concluded that without the right partner  it was impossible for the United States to succeed  no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country. It was an insight that Mr. Obama applied to his relations with other countries  from Pakistan to Israel  where his poor relationships with the leaders impeded progress. “The most underappreciated part of foreign policy ” Mr. Rhodes said  “is dealing with flawed partners. ” When Mr. Obama convened his National Security Council that day in August 2015  the Taliban were regrouping again. They had carried out audacious terrorist attacks in the center of Kabul and had mounted a military offensive in the provinces of Kunduz and Oruzgan. Worse  there was a new threat in the form of the Islamic State  also known as ISIS or ISIL  which sprouted in the poisonous soil of Iraq after the United States left and was finding recruits in the Hindu Kush. Mr. Obama had rejected a chorus of calls in Washington to delay the drawdown  under which the residual force of American troops was to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2016. “The mantra I heard was that the president does not want to hand off to his successor the mess he inherited ” said Daniel F. Feldman  who served as the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2014 and 2015. But as the Islamic State became a dire enough threat to return American troops to Iraq  Mr. Obama felt compelled to change course on Afghanistan. “ISIL thrived in a vacuum in Iraq and it pointed to a similar vacuum in Afghanistan ” Mr. Rhodes said. Mr. Obama  he said  was prodded by more than fear. After a long stretch of political paralysis  Afghanistan formed a government with Mr. Ghani in the presidency. For the first time since taking office  Mr. Obama felt like he had a partner with whom he could do business. The   Afghan Army was taking heavy casualties fighting the Taliban  and the president believed that the United States had an obligation to help them. But as Mr. Obama’s war council met that August morning  the level of American support remained the subject of intense debate. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. a skeptic about Afghanistan going back to 2009  argued that the country would revert to chaos  regardless of how long the United States stayed there. “It doesn’t matter if we leave tomorrow or 10 years from now ” he declared  according to those in the room. He was  he conceded  a “broken record” on this issue. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey  who had succeeded Admiral Mullen as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  recommended that the United States maintain a military presence in Kabul  and at Bagram and a scattering of bases in the east and south. The 10  000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular  ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control. The imperative  General Dempsey told Mr. Obama  was that Afghanistan fit into a broader counterterrorism policy from Central Asia to North Africa to extend “well beyond your presidency ” according to several officials. Mr. Obama liked that idea. It was in line  he said  with the principles he had laid out in a 2014 speech at the United States Military Academy in West Point  N. Y. where he said America would train and equip foreign armies but leave the   fighting to them. He acknowledged that it would mean handing off Afghanistan to his successor as unfinished business. “This goes to the politics of what I’m leaving for the next president ” he told the group  according to one of the participants. “My interest is not to sign them up for 10 years of X ” he added  referring to troop numbers  “but to lay out a vision and to put stakes in the ground for that vision. ” Mr. Obama now seems at an uneasy peace. In the interview in September  he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed. He had  after all  reduced the number of American troops to fewer than 10  000 from more than 100  000. They were training and assisting Afghan troops  even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry. The country had been broken to begin with  he said  and America was never going to fix it. “Afghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world with the lowest literacy rates in the world before we got there. It continues to be ” Mr. Obama said. The country “was riven with all kinds of ethnic and tribal divisions before we got there. It’s still there. ” In the end  Afghanistan became the template for a new kind of warfare  —   a chronic conflict  across an arc of unstable states  in which the United States is a participant  if not the principal actor. At a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw in July  Mr. Obama acknowledged that this prospect would disappoint an American public still suffering from combat fatigue. “It’s very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of MacArthur and the emperor meeting  and a war being officially over ” he said. “As commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world ” he went on "With the year winding down and New Year’s resolutions just around the corner  it’s time to gear up for that   clutter purge. But the thought of tackling the kitchen junk drawer  —   or even taking down the decorations  —   can be overwhelming. So to help motivate you  several organizing professionals offered tips on how to streamline your closets  beat back the toys taking over the living room and  yes  finally deal with that junk drawer. START WITH THE HOLIDAY TRAPPINGS To keep plastic ornaments and Hanukkah candles organized  use small containers you already have on hand  like popcorn and cookie tins or empty shoeboxes and egg cartons. Wrap fragile ornaments in leftover tissue paper or newspaper  or invest in storage containers like archival ornament boxes from the Container Store. For strings of lights and garlands  use zip ties to avoid tangles and put them in plastic bags labeled according to use (tree lights  porch lights  balcony  bushes  etc. ). Zip ties can also be used on wreaths  so that they can be hung on coat hangers and covered with plastic garment bags from the dry cleaner. To avoid a stockpile of holiday cards  “save only those that are meaningful and special ” Tova Weinstock  a professional organizer in Brooklyn  said. “For the others  appreciate them as you receive them and then kindly send them to the trash. ” EDIT YOUR CLOSET Eliminating clothes you never wear is easier said than done. “I don’t believe in ‘If you haven’t used or worn something in a year  get rid of it ’” said Laura Cattano  another organizer in Brooklyn. “How you want to live moving forward is a much better guide for editing than whether or not you actually have used something in the past. ” Focus on the image you would like to project  she said  then start at one end of the closet and review each piece  pulling out those you know you can toss  donate or sell. Try on anything you haven’t worn in a while and consider how it makes you feel or if it could be styled differently. Clothes you have forgotten about could be “your new favorite thing ” she said  while there may be some pieces you wear all the time that should be retired. (If you subscribe to the Marie Kondo method of decluttering  ask yourself  “Does it ‘spark joy? ’”) Sort clothes by type  grouping pants together  then shirts or blouses  jackets or dresses. “If you can’t see it  you won’t wear it ” said Sharon Lowenheim  an organizer on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the founder of the Organizing Goddess. “So remove dry cleaning bags and hang only one item per hanger. ” Arranging shirts by sleeve length  with the shortest at the front  makes them easier to find  said Ms. Lowenheim  who also subscribes to a rotation method: selecting garments to wear from the front of each section  then hanging them up toward the back after they are cleaned. “If you find yourself continually bypassing an item at the front  that is a signal to you that you just don’t like that item ” she said. “Get rid of it. ” Another way to keep your closet streamlined is to store   clothes out of sight  said Faith Roberson  an organizer in Manhattan and the founder of Organize With Faith. When clothes have been put away for half the year and you’ve done fine without them  “it changes your perspective ” she said. “You can honestly ask yourself  ‘Do I actually love this piece? And if I don’t  why am I holding onto it? ’” TACKLE THE TOYS Organizing pros agree that the best way to keep toys from taking over is to get children involved in selecting some to donate. “Finding a charity that provides toys to less fortunate children is very motivating for a child ” said Ms. Lowenheim  whose    daughter purged her playthings in this manner before each birthday and holiday  starting when she was a toddler. Before that  Ms. Lowenheim said  she would sneak into her daughter’s room while she was sleeping to gather up the games and stuffed animals she was no longer playing with. “When she was around 3  she started noticing if something was missing and would ask me about it ” Ms. Lowenheim said. “At that point  I realized that I had to involve her in the process. ” If they cooperate  be sure to respect their decision  Ms. Roberson said  even if they choose something you wouldn’t have. “Parents think about the money they’ve spent ” she said  or the sentimental value  which can make them reluctant to let go of that American Girl doll or the train set from Aunt Joan. Another strategy is to encourage them to sell the toys they no longer play with  either online or at a garage sale  and keep the proceeds for themselves. Once the toys have been pared down  Ms. Roberson swears by clear shoe or sweater drawers for storage. “They are stackable  they have dividers  are easy to clean  easy to label  and they come in four different sizes ” she said. To help maintain order  “label where each toy goes ” said Ms. Lowenheim  who recommends installing a tall bookcase and putting paints  jigsaw puzzles and other games that tend to leave a mess on the highest shelf. If your child is too young to read  label the containers with stickers or pictures. If everything has “a home” to return to at the end of the day  she said  cleanup will be easier. AND THAT JUNK DRAWER . .. “Don’t waste your time standing over the drawer sifting through it piece by piece ” Ms. Roberson said. Dump everything onto the floor or countertop  divide it into piles and then ask yourself: Do I want it? Does it work? Does it need to be in the junk drawer? If not  where else could it go? “Take it easy  and go pile by pile ” she said. Put things where they belong (like that miniature tube of toothpaste you got from the dentist that should go in your toiletries bag) and discard things you don’t need  like old keys and expired batteries and coupons. To ward off atrophy  buy a drawer organizer  suggested Ms. Lowenheim  who uses expandable drawer organizers from Staples in her own home. “The key thing is to measure the drawer  then find the organizer that best fits the space ” she said. “If it’s too small  it won’t help. ” The reward? “Keeping everything sorted by type ” she said "JERUSALEM  —   Israeli police investigators questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for three hours at his official residence on Monday evening on suspicion of receiving illicit gifts and favors from business executives. Mr. Netanyahu was questioned “under caution ” the police said in a statement  implying that there were grounds to suspect that Mr. Netanyahu might have committed a criminal offense. “No further details can be given at this stage ” the statement added. The Ministry of Justice said late Monday that Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned by investigators from Lahav 433  a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit  with the authorization of the attorney general  Avichai Mandelblit. In a detailed statement  the ministry described how the police had gathered testimony from dozens of witnesses  some abroad  and seized documents during a monthslong graft inquiry. While some aspects of the inquiry did not yield evidence of crimes  the statement said  other parts warranted a deeper investigation. Mr. Netanyahu  who has been subject to police inquiries and investigations in the past that ended without charges  has vehemently denied any impropriety. “This will all come to nothing  because there is nothing ” he has said repeatedly of the latest accusations. Local news outlets say the investigators are focused on two separate cases  one more serious than the other  but they have offered little detail on the more serious one. The less weighty one  according to reports in the newspaper Haaretz and other outlets  concerns favors for Mr. Netanyahu  and possibly for members of his family  given by Israeli and foreign business executives. The Israeli police took testimony from Ronald S. Lauder  a conservative American businessman and philanthropist  and a close friend of Mr. Netanyahu’s  when he came to Israel in late September to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres  the former prime minister and president. Upon Mr. Lauder’s arrival in Israel  he was asked to meet with the Israeli police “and respond to questions related to an investigation  to which Mr. Lauder is not a party ” Helena Beilin  a Tel   lawyer representing Mr. Lauder  said in a statement. “After a short meeting the following day  he was told that his presence was no longer needed and that there would be no need for additional meetings. This remains the case. ” Mr. Netanyahu’s office  suggesting that he is the victim of a witch hunt  issued a statement over the weekend berating the news organizations for what it described as premature and politically motivated reports. “Try to replace the prime minister at the ballot boxes  as is accepted in democracies ” it added. In televised remarks on Monday afternoon  Mr. Netanyahu told legislators from his conservative Likud Party in Parliament  “We hear the celebratory spirit and winds blowing through the television studios and in the corridors of the opposition. ” “Hold off the celebrations don’t rush ” he added. “I’ve told you before and will tell you again  —   this will come to nothing  because there is nothing. ” Mr. Netanyahu is serving his third consecutive term in office  and his fourth over all. He has exuded confidence lately  lashing out at journalists who have been critical of him  talking up Israel’s diplomatic and economic achievements  and calling in the United States ambassador to Israel  Daniel B. Shapiro  for a dressing down late last month after the Obama administration decided not to use its veto to shield Israel from a United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu  generally a popular prime minister  has developed a combative relationship with the local mainstream news media. After years of tension with the Obama administration  he also appears buoyed by the prospect of a partnership with   Donald J. Trump  who seems more sympathetic to Israeli government policies on issues like settlements. For Mr. Netanyahu’s opponents  the prospect of a possible indictment has provided a glimmer of hope  even though elections are not scheduled until late 2019. “This creates an unusual dynamic in Israeli politics ” said Nahum Barnea  a political columnist for the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth and a critic of Mr. Netanyahu. On the one hand  Mr. Barnea said  there were already signs that Netanyahu loyalists would try to promote legislation banning investigations of sitting prime ministers. On the other  he said  the question of who might succeed Mr. Netanyahu  who has no natural heir in his party  was bound to be raised. Opposition leaders were fairly subdued in their initial response. Isaac Herzog  the leader of the Zionist Union and of the opposition in Parliament  said it was “a tough day for Israel when a prime minister is under investigation. ” He added  “We are not expressing satisfaction at another’s misfortune. ” Mr. Herzog has also been the subject of police investigations over campaign funding. Yair Lapid  the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party  which has challenged Likud in recent polls  said  “The presumption of innocence applies to every Israeli  including the prime minister. ” He called for a swift investigation for the sake of the country  saying  “A person who is being investigated is a person under pressure. ” Israeli prime ministers are not obligated to step down while under investigation  unless they are charged with a crime. Nonetheless  the accusations could chip away at Mr. Netanyahu’s standing. His predecessor  Ehud Olmert  was forced from power in 2008 under the weight of police investigations and accusations of corruption  although he remained in office as a caretaker prime minister until early elections could be held in 2009. In February  Mr. Olmert became the first former Israeli prime minister to enter prison. He is serving a   term for bribery and obstruction of justice. Mr. Netanyahu described Mr. Olmert in 2008 as a “prime minister up to his neck in investigations” and said he could not be trusted to make fateful decisions under the circumstances because they might be based on personal rather than national interests. Since the 1990s  Mr. Netanyahu’s political career has been dogged by inquiries into his conduct  and that of people around him  though no charges have been filed against him. The inquiries have ranged from scandals involving travel expenses and garden furniture  —   the Netanyahus were suspected of having switched a new set bought for the prime minister’s official residence with an identical  old set in their private home in Caesarea  —   to a more recent one involving a   deal with Germany for the acquisition of submarines. That agreement came under scrutiny after it became known that Mr. Netanyahu’s personal lawyer also represents the Israeli agent of the German shipyard that builds the submarines  and other naval equipment purchased by Israel  giving rise to suspicion of a conflict of interest. In that episode  too  Mr. Netanyahu and the lawyer  David Shimron  have denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Netanyahu’s relationship with Arnaud Mimran  a French tycoon who was convicted of fraud last year  and who testified that he had contributed a large sum of money to Mr. Netanyahu for his 2009 election campaign 1.0 "PARIS  —   If the world does not envy the French enough already for their generous vacations  universal health care and fine food and wine  the arrival of 2017 brings this: a newly created “right to disconnect. ” Though ridiculed in some quarters as a ban on   email after hours  it is not quite that. But it is born of the enlightened view that it is actually beneficial for people not to work all the time  and that workers have the right to occasionally draw the line when their employer’s demands intrude on evenings at home  treasured vacations or Sundays with friends and family. “Employees are more and more connected during hours outside of the office ” Myriam El Khomri  the minister of labor  said last year in justifying the need for the law. “The boundary between professional and personal life has become tenuous ” and cases of burnout are becoming more prevalent  she said. The measure is one of a raft of new laws that took effect with the beginning of the new year and that exemplify the search for compromises between preserving French traditions and making concessions to the realities of the modern world. The new provision in the labor law does not ban   emails  but does require that companies with more than 50 employees negotiate a new protocol to ensure that work does not spill into days off or   hours. Some consultants have recommended that employees and managers avoid the “reply all” function on emails to groups so that only one person is being asked to read an email and respond  rather than half the office. Another approach recommends setting a time each evening after which employees are not expected to reply  —   several firms have designated the 10 hours between 9 p. m. and 7 a. m. others the 12 hours between 7 p. m. and 7 a. m. As a country with Catholic roots  but also a commitment to personal liberties  France has had an ambivalent approach to divorce. It has long been legal  but not necessarily speedy. A new nod to modernity in French laws eases the rules for people who want to divorce. While historically France has been far more flexible than Ireland or Italy  it still required a judge to rule on each divorce. The procedure routinely took as long as a year  and sometimes far longer  because cases were backed up awaiting the judicial signature. Now  if both members of the couple agree on the divorce  lawyers can draw up the divorce agreement  jointly sign the papers and have them notarized. No judges need be involved. Smoking is another area in which French habits have changed relatively little in recent years  —   27 to 28 percent of the population still lights up  —   but the country is now following many others in requiring “neutral packaging” for tobacco products: Instead of advertising a brand  cigarette packs sport only health warnings and photos of illnesses caused by smoking. At least two new laws demonstrate the country’s gradual move toward more sustainable products. Instead of thin plastic bags  French supermarkets and fruit vendors must substitute either bags made with a   synthetic called amidon that is mixed with plastic  a thicker type of plastic bag that could be reused  or paper bags. At Monoprix  a supermarket chain  paper bags have won out and stacks of them perch precariously on stands at the ends of fruit counters. More radical is the edict that went into effect on Sunday banning the use of pesticides in public gardens and along public highways. It promises to make public green spaces safer for birds and other small animals  which are especially vulnerable to the poisons used in pest killers. It will not be easy for the gardeners employed by cities to turn to more sustainable methods. When the city of Lyon abandoned pesticides voluntarily nine years ago  it took quite some time to change the culture  although Lyon is now considered a model. In 2019  the antipesticide law will expand to include amateur gardeners  —   a challenge not only for the French with backyard rows of dahlias and daisies  but also for those who nurse roses in their window boxes. A new   law is sure to please the French because it plays to their immense pride in local comestibles: It allows prepared foods  like frozen dinners  to be labeled “produit d’origine française” only if the item is made with 100 percent French meat or milk. Any product with more than 8 percent foreign meat must say where the animal was born
