1.0 "For Megyn Kelly  the shift from Fox News to NBC  —   where she will host a daily daytime show and a Sunday newsmagazine program  —   will be a test of whether she can connect with a broader audience in a different format and reach another level of television stardom. But her move  announced Tuesday  has broader implications for the television news industry  raising new questions about the future of Fox News  where she was a countervailing presence in an opinion lineup heavy with   ideology  and of NBC News  which has been a longtime bête noire for conservative press critics. And it comes as all news organizations gird for a new era of media coverage that arrives Jan. 20 with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. The Murdoch family  which controls Fox News’s parent company  21st Century Fox  had become so invested in Ms. Kelly as a franchise that they were prepared to pay her a salary of more than $20 million a year. People inside and outside the network widely took that to mean the Murdochs were staking the network’s future on a journalist who effectively made her name by upending the expectations for a Fox News anchor  —   for instance  by publicly taking on the Republican nominee for president. But now Fox News  long the cable news ratings leader and an influential voice in the national political debate  is on course to begin coverage of a new administration with no   anchor with Ms. Kelly’s history of challenging Mr. Trump. Her show  “The Kelly File ” was sandwiched between the   program of Bill O’Reilly  —   she was regularly second to him in the cable news ratings  —   and that of Mr. Trump’s major booster  Sean Hannity. Her departure  coming after that of Greta Van Susteren  also means that Fox faces the prospect of having no female host in prime time. That is a potentially troubling development for the network as its seeks to move past last summer‘s sexual harassment scandal involving its   and former chairman  Roger Ailes  in which many women described experiencing harassment or intimidation. (Fox is said to be looking at several potential female successors for Ms. Kelly.) For NBC  the addition of Ms. Kelly  46  may help address a challenge confronting many major news organizations: connecting with a politically diverse audience. In bringing Ms. Kelly to NBC  Andrew Lack  the chairman of the news division  is adding a journalist schooled in the preferences and worldviews of the conservative Americans who helped elect Mr. Trump  and whose anger so many news organizations failed to appreciate. Ms. Kelly’s closely watched career move capped months of drama in the political sphere  in which she was often at the center of Mr. Trump’s intense    campaign  and in the media world  where she became a key figure in the events that led to Mr. Ailes’s ouster. Ms. Kelly was the most prominent among a group of women at the network who told internal investigators that Mr. Ailes had engaged in inappropriate behavior. (Mr. Ailes has denied all the accusations.) Despite having made a generous offer to Ms. Kelly  Rupert Murdoch  an executive chairman of 21st Century Fox  whose   negotiation tactics are legendary  offered a supportive statement about her decision to leave. “We thank Megyn Kelly for her 12 years of contributions to Fox News ” the statement read. “We hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family the best. ” Though the loss of Ms. Kelly is a blow to Fox News  the network has a winning formula that has kept it atop the ratings for many years  and helped it to avoid the   its rivals experienced in the weeks after Election Day  as The Associated Press reported. And now the nation has a new Republican president whose approach speaks to the sensibilities of many of Fox’s viewers. Company executives said the Murdochs knew Ms. Kelly was a flight risk their offer included keeping her in prime time  and she had made it clear she was seeking a job that would give her more time for her family. Ms. Kelly had spoken with top executives at ABC News  CNN and in the syndication industry  as well as NBC News  but NBC remained largely under the radar as a landing spot. One person briefed on Ms. Kelly’s deliberations said that Mr. Lack won her over by starting the talks with a question about what she was seeking  instead of flatly offering possibilities. He then came back with a deal that was tailored to her preferences. A daytime show would give her a schedule that would allow her to see her children off to school and to have dinner with them and her husband  Douglas Brunt  a novelist. People briefed on the talks  who spoke on the condition of anonymity  declined to disclose what Ms. Kelly’s new annual salary would be at NBC. Fox News rivals who sought to hire Ms. Kelly away  including NBC News  had indicated that they could not match the $20 million offer from Fox  the cable news leader for the last 15 years running. But even a modest raise for Ms. Kelly would place her among television’s   journalists. The Wall Street Journal recently reported she was to collect $15 million for the final year of her contract. Her high price tag was worth it for Mr. Lack  who took over leadership of NBC News and MSNBC in 2015  14 years after he had ended an   tenure running the divisions. Executives at NBC Universal turned to him to stabilize the network after the suspension of the nightly news anchor Brian Williams for embellishing accounts of his reporting in Iraq  and as MSNBC floundered in the ratings. Among his moves since returning has been to direct MSNBC back toward more traditional  hard news coverage during its daytime hours  —   like its cable news rivals  it hit record ratings highs last year  —   and away from its yearslong market position as a   answer to Fox News  which at times colored the reputation of its sister  NBC News. Ms. Kelly will not be reporting for MSNBC  which still has     hosts like Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O’Donnell. In a brief interview  Mr. Lack said he would be closely involved in the creation of Ms. Kelly’s daytime show  which will run Monday through Friday at a time to be determined  as well as the one she will anchor on Sunday nights. That show will be in the vein of CBS’s “60 Minutes ” where Mr. Lack worked early in his career. “The thing about this that is challenging but exciting as hell is that we love making new shows ” he said. “You don’t get that opportunity that often any more  and you don’t get the opportunity to do that with a talent like Megyn. ” Yet the move has its risks for all involved  especially the daytime program. Daytime television has been notoriously difficult for news stars. People involved in the discussions said that the program was not planned to be in the mold of a traditional daytime talk show  nor much like the     special Ms. Kelly hosted last May on the Fox broadcast network  which drew some harsh criticism (some of which Ms. Kelly dismissed as liberal disappointment over a friendly interview with Mr. Trump). In an interview with Charlie Rose on “CBS Sunday Morning” last year  Ms. Kelly described the television show of her fantasies. “How about if we merge a little Charlie Rose  a little Oprah  and a little me all together ’’ she said. “And we serve that up as an hour? Wouldn’t you watch that?” Ms. Kelly kept a relatively low profile on Tuesday  addressing her own news at the end of that night’s edition of “The Kelly File. ” “This was a tough decision for me ” Ms. Kelly said "Megyn Kelly’s new office at NBC News sits a block north of Fox News headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. But it might as well be a world away. In switching networks at a pivotal point in her career  Ms. Kelly  the No.   personality in cable television news  is taking a calculated risk that she can swap her dedicated Fox audience for the broader  but more fickle  viewership of network television. There are challenges from the  . Her splashy arrival has the potential to fray nerves among the big personalities at the network  —   who already compete against one another for interviews and scoops. Ms. Kelly  46  will also be taking on a daytime talk show format that has been a virtual graveyard for television news personalities in the last 10 years. And the new Sunday newsmagazine show that NBC plans to build around Ms. Kelly will go up against a giant that has not been meaningfully challenged for decades: “60 Minutes” on CBS. Still  Ms. Kelly is a bona fide star with a   book and a breakout role in this year’s presidential campaign  when she clashed with Donald J. Trump. NBC News comes out the winner in one of the most closely watched talent sweepstakes in years  acquiring one of television’s biggest names who could play a role in any number of major network events  like coverage of elections or the Olympics. Interviews on Tuesday with network executives and producers  —   from Fox  NBC and other rival channels  —   suggest that Ms. Kelly’s performance at NBC will be as closely watched in the industry as her past few months of contract negotiations. Ms. Kelly will have to design her daytime talk show from scratch. Even though she made her name as a news anchor  she has argued that she is not obsessed with politics. When she hosted a   special on Fox in May  —   her first major foray outside cable news  —   she expressed a desire to combine the qualities of Oprah Winfrey  Barbara Walters and Charlie Rose. That special  —   which featured interviews with Mr. Trump  the celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro and the actress Laverne Cox  —   received middling reviews. It was far from a ratings hit: Among adults younger than 50  the demographic most important to broadcasters  Ms. Kelly’s special performed about as well as ABC’s “Beyond the Tank ” a   spinoff. A daily daytime talk show also poses risks.   talent like Jane Pauley  Meredith Vieira  Katie Couric and Anderson Cooper have taken a stab at the genre in the past  and each one failed. In Ms. Pauley’s case  NBC invested millions of dollars  but the show was yanked in 2005 after just one year. NBC said on Tuesday that Ms. Kelly’s show was expected to be closer to a news program than the typical daytime talk show  although it is unclear what exactly that will mean or how much appetite there is for news amid a landscape including shows like “Days of Our Lives ” “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “Steve Harvey. ” The audience for daytime television is also significantly more diverse than Fox’s   viewership. Starting a Sunday rival to “60 Minutes ” the   among newsmagazines  is likewise no easy task. “Rock Center ” which Brian Williams hosted  lasted two seasons. NBC’s most recent newsmagazine  “On Assignment ” ran    against “60 Minutes” over five weeks the show averaged about four million viewers  compared with more than nine million for “60 Minutes ” which broadcast two repeats during that time. (This season  “60 Minutes” is averaging more than 14 million viewers.) It is also unclear how NBC will accommodate Ms. Kelly’s show during the National Football League season  when NBC’s popular “Sunday Night Football” package includes a highly rated pregame show that begins at 7 p. m. Eastern. But Andrew Lack  NBC News’s chairman  has long had newsmagazines in his blood. In addition to overseeing a “60 Minutes” competitor on CBS in the 1980s  Mr. Lack presided over NBC in the 1990s when newsmagazines  including the network’s popular “Dateline ” dominated   lineups. Fox  meanwhile  must now set a course without one of its biggest names  as the network continues to recalibrate itself after the ouster of its chairman  Roger Ailes. Ms. Kelly’s exit from Fox News was so abrupt that it was announced on the day that the network had run a   ad in The Wall Street Journal trumpeting the ratings of its   lineup  with Ms. Kelly prominently pictured. Her departure stunned the Fox newsroom  where journalists and executives spent Tuesday afternoon speculating over which anchor might replace Ms. Kelly in the coveted 9 p. m. slot  —   and wondering if Ms. Kelly would even appear that night. When Greta Van Susteren  another veteran anchor  announced her departure in September  network representatives visited her home to tell her not to bother coming in. In the end  Ms. Kelly was granted a chance to bid farewell to Fox News viewers  —   her last show is Friday. It is not clear who will replace her. Fox News has never had an     lineup. Potential replacements being floated inside the network on Tuesday include four women who have regularly filled in for Ms. Kelly: Sandra Smith  a host of Fox’s noon show  “Outnumbered” Trish Regan  a rising star at Fox Business Network Shannon Bream  who covers the Supreme Court and Martha MacCallum  a morning anchor. Kimberly Guilfoyle  a host of “The Five” who is friendly with Mr. Trump’s circle  and Tucker Carlson  who has put up high ratings since taking over Fox News’s 7 p. m. slot  have also been suggested. Sean Hannity  whose viewership at 10 p. m. increased enormously in 2016 and has spiked since Election Day  could be moved up an hour  but his momentum in his time slot may make Fox executives reluctant to make a switch. One winner in the sweepstakes for Ms. Kelly could be CNN  even though it did not succeed in recruiting her. CNN  while still behind Fox News in total viewers by a wide margin  has occasionally beaten Fox among viewers 25 to 54  the demographic that determines advertising rates. In 2016  CNN finished within 58  000 viewers of Fox in prime time in the demographic  —   cutting Fox’s lead in half. Since the election  Fox has regained a sizable lead  but now  without spending a penny "QINGYUAN  China  —   The 48 soccer fields of the vast Evergrande Football School in south China seem barely enough for its 2  800 students. Against a backdrop of school spires that seem modeled on Hogwarts  the young athletes swarm onto the fields nearly every day  kicking  dribbling and passing in the hope of soccer glory and riches. “Soccer will be my career after I grow up ” Wang Kai  a gangly    who has studied at the boarding school for over three years  said after a morning session under the supervision of a Spanish coach. “I want to be the Chinese Cristiano Ronaldo ” he said  referring to the Portuguese superstar. Grooming the next Ronaldo or Messi has become a national project in China  where the country’s No. 1 fan  President Xi Jinping  is bent on transforming the country into a great soccer power. It is a moonshot for China  whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition. But the effort has already unleashed a surge of spending and support for the game that has stunned fans and players around the world. In the last two weeks  the main Chinese league has plucked foreign stars from Europe and South America with contracts reported to be worth as much as $40 million a year  the highest pay for any soccer player in the world. A Chinese club offered the real Ronaldo $105 million a year  but he declined  his agent said last week. These giddying sums are shaking the landscape of pro soccer. Antonio Conte  the manager of England’s fabled Chelsea team  denounced the Chinese spending spree last month as a “danger for all teams in the world. ” The drive to match China’s economic ascent with success on the soccer field has become emblematic of Mr. Xi’s ambition to transform China into a great and confident power. “My biggest hope for Chinese soccer is that its teams become among the world’s best ” he announced in 2015. In the last two years  the government has poured the kind of concentrated effort into soccer that it has previously devoted to winning Olympic medals in individual sports like diving and gymnastics. It has promised to clean up and reorganize professional soccer and build a new generation of players by creating tens of thousands of soccer fields and adding soccer programs in tens of thousands of schools. The aim is to establish a flow of top players eventually capable of winning the coveted men’s World Cup and returning the women’s team to its former glory. That effort has emboldened Chinese clubs to spend lavishly. As well as paying tens of millions for foreign players  Chinese team owners have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying into European clubs  hoping to tap their coaching and marketing expertise. “Current spending has created massive expectations ” said Simon Chadwick  a professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford in Britain. “Spending big on players is also about acquiring heroes and icons. ” But if soccer distills Mr. Xi’s national ambitions  it also illustrates how his plans could falter  as they have in other arenas  in a muddle of rushed and distorted enforcement  especially at the local level. There has been resistance by parents  worried about their children taking precious time away from academics  as well as fear that splurging on foreign stars diverts money and attention from fostering homegrown talent. The pitfalls in fixing soccer  it turns out  are a bit like those in fixing the economy a desire for quick  flashy success is putting   goals at risk. People’s Daily  the main newspaper of the Communist Party  warned last month of a “bubble” of reckless spending in Chinese professional soccer that could burst and badly damage the sport. Too many investors had feverish expectations  while some clubs  officials and schools were only going through the motions of developing young players  the newspaper said. “One of the biggest problems is ” said Cameron Wilson  a Scottish resident of Shanghai who edits Wild East Football  a website that follows the sport in China. “There are these great plans and ideas. But when it gets down to the   level in the provinces  it’s like people doing their own thing. ” China’s passionate soccer fans would be thrilled to have competitive national teams instead of the lackluster ones they have now. The national men’s team recently placed 83rd in FIFA rankings  just ahead of the Faroe Islands  a remote outcrop of Denmark with fewer than 50  000 inhabitants  and it is unlikely to win a spot in the 2018 World Cup. The women’s team  —   the pride of Chinese soccer in past decades  —   has stumbled. It was   for the Women’s World Cup in 1999 but slipped to 13th in the latest  rankings. “The national team is a joke ” said Xu Yun  16  who had come to Workers’ Stadium in Beijing to watch his favorite Beijing team clobber a listless opponent from Henan Province. “I think it will need decades to get it right. It’s not just a question of spending money  it’s attitude. ” For years  the domestic professional game was riddled with corruption  brazen even by China’s   standards. Since   revelations grew into a national scandal in 2009  the worst cheating has been cleaned up. “It still exists ” Mr. Wilson said. “Just not so blatantly. ” For Xi  soccer has been a passion since childhood. His trips abroad have included photographs with David Beckham and other soccer celebrities. In Ireland in 2012  he famously had an enthusiastic but seemingly rusty go at kicking a ball. In September  he revisited his old school in Beijing  where he learned to kick and became a fan of the game  according to memoirs of his former teacher. “Look how healthy I am ” Mr. Xi told young soccer players at the school. “I laid the basis for that through sports when I was young. ” Private investors have piled into professional soccer  encouraged by Xi’s backing for the game and apparently eager to curry favor with his government. In the main pro trading season last year  the 16 Chinese Super League teams spent about $300 million hiring away promising foreign players  outstripping player spending by the English Premier League by nearly $120 million  according to FIFA TMS  a player transfer data company. Prices in 2017 are likely to go even higher. But Mr. Xi’s focus is on the long game and the next generation of players. His plan calls for 50  000 schools to have a strong emphasis on soccer by 2025  a leap from 5  000 in 2015. The number of soccer fields across the country will grow to over 70  000 by the end of 2020  from under 11  000. By then  the plan says  50 million Chinese  including 30 million students  will regularly play soccer. “Now principals at every school are paying quite a bit more attention to soccer ” said Dai Wei  the athletic director at r. Xi’s old school  the Bayi School. “That was unthinkable before. ” Yet there is deep cultural resistance  even at Bayi. Some parents discourage their children from committing time to sports  Mr. Dai said  because they have so much homework and face stiff competition on academic exams. While China has excelled at individual sports that demand intense discipline from an early age  the country has not done as well at fostering group sports  where skills like teamwork and improvisation count as much as personal virtuosity. The privately run Evergrande school  the world’s biggest soccer boarding school  says its formula of intense training combined with a solid education could show the way for developing young players. “As more soccer schools are built  there’ll be more and more kids playing  and the stars will multiply  too ” said Liu Jiangnan  the principal of the school  which opened in 2012. “I’d guess that in seven or eight years  half the members of the Chinese national squad will come from this school. ” Drawn by such hopes  parents pay up to about $8  700 a year to send children here  where 24 Spanish coaches oversee training. Students spend 90 minutes a day on drills and also play on weekends. Promising players get scholarships  and children from poorer families get discounts  school officials said. But even here  the children come to the game later than their European and South American counterparts  and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics  said Sergio Zarco Diaz  a Spanish coach. “The kids are getting better  year by year ” he said hopefully. But the Evergrande approach is too expensive to be widely copied. Some schools  facing a shortage of coaches and space for fields  have devised their own drills  like soccer gymnastics  in which children stand in lines tossing a ball up  down and around. It may impress visiting officials  but it is scant preparation for the free flow of the game  said Zhang Lu  a widely respected soccer commentator. “Chinese soccer has failed before through rushing for instant success ” Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing  recalling previous failed efforts to build up the game in the 1980s and 1990s. “The problem is that everyone’s thinking is still deeply set in traditional ideas. Everyone thinks soccer is just about getting results  competition  training  creating stars. ” Mr. Zhang has instead been encouraging schools to focus on fun and broad participation. That approach gives more children a break from the monotony of the classroom and will eventually bring out more future champions than an elitist    approach  he argues. Some schools are trying his way. On a recent afternoon  the smog that often covers Beijing lifted and the children of Caoqiao Elementary School rushed onto the fields  shouting and squealing with delight. “This morning soccer had been canceled because of the smog ” said the principal  Lin Yanling. “But at midday I notified the kids that it was back on "In the technology industry  the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years  the biggest players in tech  —   from IBM to   to Cisco to Yahoo  —   were eventually outmaneuvered by   that came out of nowhere. The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow  blind and dumb  to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place. Then  in the last half decade  something strange happened: The sharks began to get bigger and smarter. Nearly a year ago  I argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business  one that is typified less by the storied   in a garage than by a posse I like to call the Frightful Five: Amazon  Apple  Facebook  Microsoft and Alphabet  Google’s parent company. Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year  their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible  but also maybe even probable. In 2017  much the same story remains  but there is a new wrinkle: The world’s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States  Europe  Asia and South America  the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers  and often even against popular will. The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region  including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump’s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds. This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So  happy New Year. Let’s start with some stats. In 2017  the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016  they are half of the world’s 10 most valuable companies  when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends  —   mobile phones  social networks  the web  the cloud  retail and logistics  and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs. Meanwhile  the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech  —   on autos  health care  retail  transportation  entertainment and finance. The Five aren’t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple’s sales were flat last year  and after a monster 2016  Alphabet’s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren’t entirely safe from competition from   and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot. Still  at the moment  thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a   outlook  the Five sure do look insulated from competition from   today’s most valuable tech upstarts  like Airbnb  Uber and Snap  could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five. What has changed is public perception. For years  most of the Five enjoyed broad cultural good will. They were portrayed in the news media as forces of innovation and delight  as the best that American capitalism had to offer. The exceptions were Microsoft  which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s  and Amazon  which got under people’s skin for  among other things  making books cheaper and more widely accessible  thereby hurting bookstores. But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you’re supposed to in America  —   by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren’t considered that bad. They weren’t causing environmental disasters. They weren’t selling cigarettes. They weren’t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five’s growing invincibility last year  the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn’t I called them the Fabulous Five? Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt as technology wormed deeper into our lives  it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with. Silicon Valley grew cloistered  missing people’s unease with the speed with which their innovations were changing our lives. When Apple took on the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year over access to a terrorist’s iPhone  many in tech sided with the company  but a majority of Americans thought Apple should give in. During the long presidential campaign  Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner  Jeff Bezos  was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos’s main company  Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump  but the industry’s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public. For years  most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised  —   entertainment giants  cable and phone companies  and the news media  among others. “During the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters  in general the U. S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters ” said Julius Genachowski  the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group  a private equity firm. That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years  and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them. During Mr. Genachowski’s term at the F. C. C. and then again during the term of his successor  Tom Wheeler  the commission passed rules favoring “network neutrality ” which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies. But as Mr. Genachowski noted  as the disrupters grow  the dynamic often shifts. “The next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents  and then you see two things  —   battles between incumbents and other incumbents  and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents ” he said. That’s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves  and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments  who will look to both sides of the ledger  —   their benefits to society as well as their potential costs  —   when deciding how to police them. But there’s a twist: With the Five  unlike in previous eras of tech  it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today’s  . The battles for dominance in cloud services  artificial intelligence and data mining    assistants    cars  virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five. That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power  things could be fabulous 1.0 "BEIJING  —   A city official in southwest China unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the city’s mayor and Communist Party secretary during a meeting on Wednesday  injuring them before fleeing and killing himself  the official news media reported. Privately owned guns are rare in China  because of a virtual ban on civilian use  and grisly attacks on officials by colleagues are also uncommon. So rumors of the shooting in Panzhihua  an industrial city in Sichuan Province  rippled quickly across the Chinese internet even before the local authorities confirmed the news. Panzhihua was built as part of Mao’s plans to relocate factories deep inland  where they would be protected from a feared war. But the violence in this isolated site was nonetheless an embarrassing breach of the efforts by China’s president  Xi Jinping  to remake officialdom into a clean  impeccably disciplined bureaucracy. Details were sparse  and there were no clues to the gunman’s motives. But the brief initial report in the state media sketched a scene of the head of the Panzhihua Land and Resources Bureau  Chen Zhongshu  bursting into a meeting at an exhibition center and opening fire on officials there. “The gunman stormed into the meeting  fired repeatedly at the main leading comrades of the city party committee and government and then fled ” said an online report by Sichuan Daily  an official provincial newspaper  citing the Panzhihua government press office. The suspect in the shooting  Mr. Chen  was found dead in the exhibition center. He had taken his own life  the report said without giving details. The mayor  Li Jianqin  and party secretary  Zhang Yan  were wounded and sent to the hospital  but their injuries were not considered   the report said. Mr. Zhang  the party secretary  has worked in Panzhihua since 2006  and the mayor  Mr. Li  has worked there since last year  according to Chinese news reports. Both officials went to meetings and inspection visits with Mr. Chen previously
