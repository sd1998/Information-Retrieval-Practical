12.0 "Just how   is Hillary Kerr  the    founder of a   digital media company in Los Angeles? She can tell you what song was playing five years ago on the jukebox at the bar where she somewhat randomly met the man who became her husband. It was “These Days ” the version sung by Nico  the German   made famous by Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground. Actually  the song had been playing just before she met Jonathan Leahy  now 38  on that December night in 2011 at the 4100 Bar in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles. Ms. Kerr can’t remember exactly what was playing when they met because at that moment she was jumping up and down “like Tigger ” as she put it. In answering the usual     questions  Mr. Leahy told her he was a music supervisor for “Girls ” the HBO show created by and starring Lena Dunham. That was enough to get Ms. Kerr bouncing. “Your music has changed my life!” she told Mr. Leahy. Mr. Leahy  who is quiet but not shy (at least he doesn’t jump up and down upon meeting people) was mesmerized. “My main reaction ” he said  “was it’s a lot easier to talk to beautiful women in a bar when you’re working on a hit show. ” They exchanged email addresses  more an act of politeness than promise. Then their soundtrack went quiet for almost a year. Both Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr had active social lives  but they were focused on their careers. Mr. Leahy  who grew up in Laconia  N. H. graduated from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg  Va. in 2000 and landed in Los Angeles later that year. Now he is a music supervisor with Aperture Music and is joined by Manish Raval and Tom Wolfe in being responsible for the music on “Girls. ” The team has also worked on films including “Trainwreck” and television series such as “New Girl. ” In addition  Mr. Leahy is the music supervisor for “Survivor’s Remorse” on Starz. Ms. Kerr grew up in the La Jolla section of San Diego  graduated from the University of Southern California in 2000 and eventually made her way to New York  where she took a job as an assistant at Elle magazine. In 2005 she moved back to the West Coast  to Los Angeles  and with a fellow Elle alum   Katherine Power  created a company best known for its website  Who What Wear  which casts an eye on celebrity culture and fashion it now has 13 million monthly unique visitors. Ms. Kerr and Ms. Power also started the Who What Wear clothing and accessories line sold at Target. It was nine months after their initial meeting that Mr. Leahy emailed Ms. Kerr. He had a friend who wanted to get into the fashion industry. Ms. Kerr  Mr. Leahy and his friend met for a long  boozy brunch. They began to email and text a bit. “There was banter ” Ms. Kerr said  but neither knew the interest or intention of the other. A few months later  she texted to ask if he could help her score a ticket to see the band Lord Huron. Mr. Leahy happens to be a friend of Ben Schneider  the band’s lead singer  and had an extra ticket. “This was one of those moments where the universe conspires to make you seem cooler than you actually are ” Mr. Leahy said. He and Ms. Kerr met up at the show. That is when Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr moved into the ambiguous “mixtape era ” in which for months they emailed and texted each other with coy “are we just friends or what” texts revolving around music. For example  Ms. Kerr was visiting New York and texted Mr. Leahy a request for “walking around SoHo music. ” He sent her a link to “Love Me Again ” by John Newman. It has a club vibe but romantic lyrics. “I wanted to read into it ” Ms. Kerr said  but she figured (correctly  it turns out) that her new friend was a bit of a clueless guy who didn’t spend much time thinking about how a woman might react to such a song being shared with her. Another time he emailed her a link to a Fleetwood Mac version of “Need Your Love So Bad. ” After listening to it  Ms. Kerr said  “I called my friend Katie. ” “At that time ” she continued  “I just referred to him as ‘the supervisor.’ She knew I had a crush on him. She said  ‘How can it not mean something? ’” Mr. Leahy acknowledged that it might be difficult for a person to think he was not sending Ms. Kerr a message with this song. “I sort of thought  ‘Maybe it’s too much. ’” But he shared it with her anyway. (This is the same man who sent her the song “BedBedBedBedBed  Vacationer Remix ” by Deleted Scenes  “during the friend phase ” Ms. Kerr said.) Ms. Kerr played the game  too. She made Mr. Leahy a mix CD (handwritten liner notes and all) that she titled “Feynman Diagrams for All ” after Mr. Leahy told her in a text conversation that he thought the idea of Feynman diagrams  —   in which physicists map out the interactions of subatomic particles  —   was romantic. On the mix  Ms. Kerr included the Mazzy Star song “I’ve Been Let Down. ” It was “a bit of an Easter egg of my actual feelings ” she said. Around this time  Ms. Kerr texted Mr. Leahy a photo of the drink menu from a bar   the Roger Room. She had focused on a drink named for the song “Christmas Card From a Hooker in Minneapolis ” which happens to be Mr. Leahy’s favorite Tom Waits tune. “This made me rethink things a bit ” he said  adding  “Hillary Kerr was clearly not to be trifled with. ” In early 2014  Mr. Leahy invited her to a Bleachers concert. The band’s lead singer is Jack Antonoff  who is Ms. Dunham’s boyfriend. Ms. Dunham was at the concert as well  and on meeting Ms. Kerr  she said  “I’ve heard so much about you. ” Ms. Kerr and Mr. Leahy shared their first kiss that night. He proposed to her on Polihale Beach in Kauai  Hawaii  on Jan. 1  2016. On Dec. 10  125 friends and relatives gathered in Palm Springs  Calif. at the Colony Palms Hotel  which was opened in 1936 by the reputed mobster Al Wertheimer and whose poolside guests have included Frank Sinatra  Ronald Reagan  Kirk Douglas and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Ms. Kerr walked down a grassy aisle in a   courtyard wearing a structured lace Reem Acra dress  strapless with a bustier and a full skirt. Four musicians played “Once  With Feeling ” an instrumental song Mr. Leahy wrote for Ms. Kerr. . Just minutes into the cocktail reception  a few of Ms. Kerr’s best friends descended upon her. Jen Atkin  the celebrity hairstylist and social media star  started fussing with the flower she had sewn into the bride’s hair. Joey Maalouf  the celebrity makeup artist who is a creator of the       service the Glam App  whipped out a tube of lip gloss and reapplied it to the bride’s pucker. He had done her makeup. “The look we went for is sickeningly stunning and perfect ” he said. Guests mingled over drinks by the pool  which was framed by banquette tables lit from above by strings of bulbs. The sky turned pink before the stars appeared  and guests snapped photos and shared them with the hundreds of thousands who follow these members of the   illuminati (#imwithkerr and #letsgetleahyed). “This looks like it’s art directed ” Eva Chen  the head of fashion partnerships for Instagram  said as she took it all in. She had worked as an assistant at Elle with Ms. Kerr. Friends of both the bride and the groom celebrated what they saw as a great match  based on passion not only for each other but also for music. Leigh Belz Ray  the features and news director at InStyle  was another former Elle colleague who made the trip. “Hillary loves music  and it’s not just a casual thing ” Ms. Ray said. “We used to say the ultimate fantasy was to become a music director  and now she’s married to one. ” After a romantic first dance to Solomon Burke’s “If You Need Me ” Mr. and Mrs. Leahy (she will use her maiden name professionally) settled into several hours of serious dancing to songs spun by a D. J. And before they left for their Hawaiian honeymoon  Mr. Leahy completed his first important act as husband. He pulled together many of the songs that could be considered the soundtrack to their romance and made his wife a mixtape. When Dec. 10  2016 Where Colony Palms Hotel  Palm Springs  Calif. Flora The bride and groom were married under a white birch trellis  because white birch is the state tree of New Hampshire  where Mr. Leahy grew up and where his parents  Richard and Marie Leahy  reside. The structure was wrapped in white peonies  Sahara roses and camellia greens. Readings Mr. Leahy’s family is Roman Catholic Ms. Kerr’s parents  John and Carole Kerr  are more spiritual than religiously observant. Many of the guests had an artistic bent. The bride and groom planned accordingly. Marshall Goldsmith  an executive coach  author and lifelong family friend of Ms. Kerr  officiated. Friends and relatives stood to read poems from James Kavanaugh and Mary Oliver  as well as a passage from the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling legalizing   marriage. “A little Catholic priest  a little lesbian Pulitzer Prize winner  a little equal rights for all "Angels are everywhere in the Muñiz family’s apartment in the Bronx: paintings of angels on the wall  ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR  angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves. As José and Zoraida Muñiz and their children have struggled to deal with a   series of trials and setbacks  including cancer  debilitating epilepsy  deep depression and near eviction  it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together. Zoraida’s early life in Puerto Rico was like something from a tropical Dickens novel. She and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the children’s father withdrew support. Then Zoraida’s grandfather  —   the father of her absent father  —   destroyed the house in a rage. She was barely a teenager when she met José  a Vietnam War veteran. With permission from her uncle  a judge  they were married. She was 14. He was 29. They moved to New York in 1983 and started a new life. He built boilers. She worked in construction  using skills she learned as a child  and in a clothing store. But in 1987  Mr. Muñiz began having violent seizures  —   eight or 10 a day. They did not respond to medication. He could no longer work. She stopped working to take care of him. Still determined to live something like a normal life  they started a family. Their first child  José Jr. had a heart defect. By the time he was 2 he had had six   operations. That’s where the angels came in  —   the first one was a painting  a gift from a cousin.  “When they operated on my son  they told me he was an angel  because he was supposed to die ” Ms. Muñiz  50  said. “From there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family. ” All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives  or picked up off the street  just like all the furniture in the Muñizes’ overstuffed apartment in a   complex on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx  much of it restored by Ms. Muñiz. “So many people throw away things  so I don’t have to buy ” she said. A second son  Jesus  became epileptic at 3. A girl  Maria  completed the family. In 2007  Mr. Muñiz had what felt like a horrible  stubborn toothache. It turned out to be cancer of the lower jaw. Ms. Muñiz stayed in the room with her husband while he received radiation treatment. “I’m willing to take anything with him ” she said. “I never left him alone  and I never will. ” Radiation did not work. To save Mr. Muñiz’s life  surgeons removed his tongue and his lower jaw and cut a hole through his esophagus. Disfigured  depressed and unable to speak  he can consume nothing thicker than milk and needs   care. This is the household where the Muñiz children grew up. “We’ve been through every craziness ” said José Jr. 24  who has suffered depression so severe that he dropped out of college and confined himself to the apartment  “every up and down. ” For years at a time  the family held on  seemingly by a thread. Over the summer  the younger son  Jesus  22  got a   job at a Zaro’s Bakery in Manhattan’s financial district. Because the family’s rent is tied to income  the rent tripled in August  to about $770 a month from $245. But Jesus had school bills to pay  and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for José Sr. ’s mother  who died over the summer  and things began to unravel. They fell behind on the rent and utilities. Food was often scarce. The family regularly skipped meals. It was around this time that Ms. Muñiz got in touch with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York  one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund. It covered their back rent  got them warm coats and blankets and helped them apply for food stamps for the first time. And with $600 from the Neediest Cases Fund  the family paid its electric bill. Things are looking up in some ways. Jesus is returning to college  where he is on a   track and wants to be a paramedic. Maria graduated in December from a   nursing program. Thinking of her father and his illness  she wants to be an oncologist. José Jr. was just accepted to the New York Film Academy’s photography program. But José Sr. continues to battle cancer. Zoraida is severely depressed. What keeps her going? she was asked. She gestured toward her family  sitting beside her beneath the painted angels. “They give me my strength  even if I have times I collapse ” she said. José Jr. agreed. “I use my parents and siblings as my motivation ” he said. “We’re all there for each other "With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House  it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry. After all  Mr. Trump has mocked the science of global warming as a Chinese hoax  threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory. So consider what happened in the middle of December  after investors had had a month to absorb the implications of Mr. Trump’s victory. The federal government opened bidding on a tract of the ocean floor off New York State as a potential site for a huge wind farm. Up  up and away soared the offers  —   interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day. In the end  the winning bidder offered the federal Treasury $42 million  more than twice what the government got in August for oil leases  —   oil leases  —   in the Gulf of Mexico. Who won the bid? None other than Statoil  the Norwegian oil company  which is in the midst of a major campaign to turn itself into a big player in renewable energy. We do not know for sure that the New York wind farm will get built  but we do know this: The energy transition is real  and Mr. Trump is not going to stop it. On a global scale  more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy. That is more than $300 billion a year  a sign of how powerful the momentum has become. Wind power is booming in the United States  with the industry adding manufacturing jobs in the reddest states. When Mr. Trump’s appointees examine the facts  they will learn that   technician is projected to be the   occupation in America over the next decade. The election of Mr. Trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair. They had pinned their hopes on a Hillary Clinton victory and a continuation of President Obama’s strong push to tackle global warming. Now  of course  everything is in flux. In the worst case  with a sufficiently pliant Congress  Mr. Trump could roll back a decade of progress on climate change. Barring some miraculous conversion on Mr. Trump’s part  his election cannot be interpreted as anything but bad news for the climate agenda. Yet despair might be an overreaction. For starters  when Mr. Trump gets to the White House  he will find that the federal government actually has relatively little control over American energy policy  and particularly over electricity generation. The coal industry has been ravaged in part by cheap natural gas  which is abundant because of technological changes in the way it is produced  and there is no lever in the Oval Office that Mr. Trump can pull to reverse that. The intrinsically weak federal role was a source of frustration for Mr. Obama and his aides  but now it will work to the benefit of environmental advocates. They have already persuaded more than half the states to adopt mandates on renewable energy. Efforts to roll those back have largely failed  with the latest development coming only last week  when Gov. John Kasich of Ohio  a Republican  vetoed a rollback bill. The federal government does offer important subsidies for renewable energy  and they will surely become a target in the new Congress. But those subsidies are already scheduled to fall drastically over five years  in a deal cut a year ago that gave the oil industry some favors and that passed Congress with many Republican votes. If Mr. Trump pushes for an early end to the subsidies  he will find that renewable energy has friends in the Republican Party. Topping that list is Charles E. Grassley  the senior senator from Iowa. That state  —     in presidential politics  let us remember  —   will soon be getting 40 percent of its electricity from wind power. “Senator Grassley has been and continues to be an extraordinary leader and champion for the wind industry ” said Tom Kiernan  the head of the American Wind Energy Association  a trade group. When I spoke with him last week  Mr. Kiernan did not sound like a man gnashing his teeth about the impending Trump era. By his group’s calculations  $80 billion of wind industry investment is in the pipeline for the United States over the next few years. “We are creating jobs throughout America    jobs  and we think   Trump will want that to continue ” he said. If Mr. Trump really wanted to roll back the clock  he could try to get Congress to override all the state mandates  a gross violation of the supposed conservative commitment to federalism. But it would be a titanic fight  some Republican senators would defect on principle  and Mr. Trump would almost certainly lose. So if the damage Mr. Trump can do domestically is limited by circumstance  what about the international effort against global warming? That is the prospect that has David G. Victor most worried. Dr. Victor  a professor at the University of California at San Diego  is one of the closest observers of global climate politics. While the nations of the world agreed a year ago to a landmark deal to tackle global warming  that consensus is fragile  he pointed out. The Paris Agreement is really an outline more promise than reality. Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw. Right now  other countries are saying they will go forward even if he does so  but it is not hard to imagine the thing unraveling. As part of the negotiations  the Obama administration promised billions of dollars from American taxpayers to help poor countries adjust to the devastation of global warming. “That’s a big part of the glue that held the Paris deal together ” Dr. Victor pointed out. Mr. Trump is considered likely to abandon that pledge. Perhaps the biggest threat to the climate agenda posed by the incoming administration is not anything that Mr. Trump might do  but rather what he will not do. While the energy transition is real  it is still in its earliest stages. Iowa may soon get 40 percent of its power from wind  but for the United States as a whole  the figure is closer to 5 percent. The transition is simply not happening fast enough. The pledges countries made in Paris  even if kept  are not ambitious enough. To meet the climate goals embodied in the Paris Agreement  the world needed an American president who would have pushed hard to accelerate the energy transition. You can debate whether Mrs. Clinton would have been that president  but it is certainly clear that Mr. Trump will not be. So as Washington goes into reverse gear on climate policy  seas will keep rising and heat waves will get worse. Later this month  global monitoring agencies are expected to report that 2016 was the hottest year in the historical record  beating out 2015  which beat out 2014. If nothing else "THOMPSONS  Tex.  —   Can one of the most promising  —   and troubled  —   technologies for fighting global warming survive during the administration of Donald J. Trump? The technology  carbon capture  involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the   gas can make its way into the atmosphere. Mr. Trump’s denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change  a view shared by many of his cabinet nominees  might appear to doom any such environmental initiatives. But the new Petra Nova plant about to start running here  about 30 miles southwest of Houston  is a bright spot for the technology’s supporters. It is being completed essentially on time and within its budget  unlike many previous such projects. When it fires up  the plant  which is attached to one of the power company NRG’s hulking   units  will draw 90 percent of the CO2 from the emissions produced by 240 megawatts of generated power. That is a fraction of the roughly 3  700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant  the largest in the Lone Star State. Still  it is enough to capture 1. 6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year  —   equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3. 5 billion miles  or the CO2 from generating electricity for 214  338 homes. From a tower hundreds of feet above the Petra Nova operation  the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an Erector set fanatic  with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plant’s skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors. Petra Nova uses the most common technology for carbon capture. The exhaust stream  pushed down a snaking conduit to the Petra Nova equipment  is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines  which bond with the carbon dioxide. That solution is pumped to a regenerator  or stripper  which heats the amine and releases the CO2. The gas is drawn off and compressed for further use  and the amine solution is then cycled back through the system to absorb more CO2. Petra Nova  a   joint venture of NRG and JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration  will not just grab the CO2  it will use it  pushing compressed CO2 through a new pipeline 81 miles to an oil field. The gas will be injected into wells  a technique known as enhanced oil recovery  that should increase production to 15  000 barrels a day from about 300 barrels a day. And since NRG owns a quarter of the oil recovery project  what comes out of the ground will help pay for the carbon capture operation. The plant  which has received $190 million from the federal government  can be economically viable if the price of oil is about $50 a barrel  said David Knox  an NRG spokesman. The company expects to declare the plant operational in January  Mr. Knox said. Aware of problems with carbon capture projects around the country and of the risks of hubris  he said: “We’re not going to declare victory before it’s time. ” If the price of oil stabilizes or rises  and if tax breaks for developing the technology continue and markets for carbon storage develop  he said  utilities might ask  “why would I not want to put a carbon capture system on my plant?” But developing   carbon capture has been neither straightforward nor easy. So far  problems have bedeviled major projects  often costing far more than projected and taking longer to complete. The federal government has canceled projects like Future Gen  which was granted more than $1 billion by the Obama administration. Carbon capture systems are not just expensive to build they tend to be   and make the plant less efficient over all  —   a problem known as “parasitic load. ” The Petra Nova carbon capture process gets its energy from a separate power plant constructed for the purpose  which NRG says makes the system more efficient than it would otherwise be  and frees up all of the capacity of the main power plant to sell all of the electricity it produces. The company estimates that the next plant it builds could cost 20 percent less  thanks to lessons learned this time around. If Petra Nova succeeds  it means a boost for carbon capture. Despite carbon capture’s problems  its supporters  including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency  call the technology  known as carbon capture sequestration  crucial for meeting emissions standards that can prevent the worst effects of climate change. “If you don’t have C. C. S. the chance of success goes down  and the cost of success goes up ” said Julio Friedmann  an expert at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California and a former Energy Department official. “If you do have C. C. S. the chance of success goes up and the cost of success goes down. ” Carbon capture is proving itself  said David Mohler  the deputy assistant secretary for clean coal and carbon management at the federal Energy Department. Developing technologies often involves delay and cost overruns initially  he said. “You cannot engineer all the bugs out from inside a cubicle  —   you really have to do this stuff in the real world ” he said. Driving down costs  he noted  is what engineers and businesses do through research  development and production. He cited the plummeting cost of initially expensive technologies like solar power. “We do figure things out as we go ” he said. What the Trump administration will do with carbon capture is  at this point  anyone’s guess. “The technology only makes sense in a world where you are seeking to avoid putting CO2 into the atmosphere ” said Mark Brownstein  a vice president for the climate and energy program at the Environmental Defense Fund. But some supporters of the technology see reasons for hope. “I actually think it’s a moment of optimism ” said Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota  who met with Mr. Trump last month as a potential agriculture secretary. Ms. Heitkamp   legislation  with another Democrat  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island  to expand and extend tax breaks for carbon capture projects. “What I saw with the   was a laserlike focus on jobs ” she said. “I think he was intrigued” about the economic opportunity that carbon capture could provide to keep coal power generation in the national mix  she added. One of the pillars of Mr. Trump’s campaign was his intention to revive the fortunes of the coal industry through support of   clean coal. And while the exact meaning of the   phrase is open to interpretation  it generally includes not just technologies that remove soot and   pollutants  but also carbon dioxide. Ms. Heitkamp said that businesses  too  were likely to continue development of carbon capture technology  since they planned their plant investments on a curve of decades and are loath to change course because of a single election. “The decision they are making is not  what does the political outlook look like today? What’s it look like over the life of this plant?” Although she concedes that a   revival of coal’s fortunes is unlikely  carbon capture could be a way to extend the life of current facilities while keeping the nation’s energy mix diverse. Jeff Erikson  general manager at the Global C. C. S. Institute  which promotes the technology  said he did not expect to see a great number of new coal plants on the way. “I wouldn’t say carbon capture is going to rescue the coal industry ” he said  but pointed out that there is great potential for applying carbon capture to diverse natural gas plants and to industrial applications. Captured carbon can be used not just for oil production but a widening range of industrial processes  or can even be pumped into the ground. One of the most innovative approaches to carbon capture is being tried 50 miles east of the Petra Nova plant  in La Porte  Tex. where a consortium of companies is trying an entirely new approach to   power generation. In a $140 million  50 megawatt demonstration project  the company  Net Power  will use superheated carbon dioxide in much the same way that conventional power plants use steam to drive turbines. This system  invented by a British engineer  Rodney Allam  eliminates the inefficiency inherent in heating water into steam and cooling it again. The power plant produces a stream of very pure  pressurized carbon dioxide that is ready for pipelines without much of the additional processing that conventional carbon capture systems require. The creators say that their technology will produce electric power at a price comparable to   power plants  the efficient   plants that burn gas to power one turbine and then use the excess heat from that process to generate additional power with a steam turbine. That means  in effect  that “the cost of being green is zero ” said Bill Brown  the chief executive of Net Power. “The potential to capture CO2 at no additional cost would be a game changer ” said Fatima Maria Ahmad  a fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions  a think tank. Net Power combines the resources of Exelon Generation  a power company  the engineering and construction firm CBI  and 8 Rivers Capital  which developed the technology used in the project. The centerpiece of the project is a special turbine built by Toshiba and designed for the punishingly high pressure used in the process. And while any system that so closely resembles a rocket engine has the potential for what engineers delicately refer to as a RUD  —   “rapid unplanned disassembly”  —   those working directly on the project say they have designed safety features that give them confidence. Even if the United States government shows little interest in reducing the nation’s carbon footprint under Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress  consortium officials say they expect to find ready customers from companies in the United States and around the globe  where the threat of climate change is fully acknowledged. “We see this very much playing into all parts of the world ” said Daniel McCarthy  executive vice president for CBI’s technology operating group. Environmentalists remain divided on the issue of carbon capture  said John Coequyt  global climate policy director for Sierra Club. “This is the issue where the biggest range of positions exists within the environmental community ” he said. Groups like the Clean Air Task Force favor it strongly. Other factions call clean coal a fig leaf to keep coal  with all of its environmental baggage  in the energy mix. And many suggest the billions of dollars spent on trying to capture carbon would be better directed to the technologies that don’t pollute the atmosphere in the first place. Dr. Friedmann  the former energy official  predicted that the technology would prove its usefulness. “It’s convenient to just say ‘Keep it in the ground ’ ” he said 1.0 "WEST PALM BEACH  Fla.  —   When   Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend  he did it in   opulence  joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone  the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. Trump’s    resort in Palm Beach. President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford  Tex. His father had a compound in Kennebunkport  Me. President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii  staying at a private home. But Mr. Trump’s   private club in Florida  where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City  is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th president’s winter White House. And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post  the cereal heiress and the property’s original owner  who left    to the federal government when she died in 1973  hoping it would serve as a home for presidents. But the government had no interest in her plan  and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $10 million  turning it into a club where membership costs six figures. Mr. Trump’s arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite  and he opened up   ’s membership to Jews and   who had been excluded from other   establishments. He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple. Since Mr. Trump’s victory in November     has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club: the chance to rub shoulders with the next president. “It’s like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long ” said Jeff Greene  a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010  who is a    member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter. Instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan  Mr. Trump has been seated at an ornately designed couch  upholstered in pale fabric laced with gold  beneath a chandelier hanging from the ceiling  a scene resembling a mansion in “Sunset Boulevard” or “Citizen Kane ” two of Mr. Trump’s favorite movies. At night  the couches are moved out and tables are added to accommodate the evening cocktail crowd  among whom Mr. Trump moves from one table to the next  the most powerful greeter in the world. At the annual New Year’s Eve party on Saturday night  a   white menu included “Mr. Trump’s wedge salad ” a wild mushroom and Swiss chard ravioli and a “breakfast buffet. ” Those in attendance drifted in under a    striped awning  the men dressed in tuxedos  the women in ball gowns  many with their hair swept high. Guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party. Mr. Trump later delivered remarks  according to a guest  who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years. Howie Carr  a conservative radio host who was supportive of Mr. Trump  roamed the crowd  with Mr. Carr posting on Twitter that his daughter asked Mr. Trump if she could be an intern in the White House. Mr. Trump’s two adult sons  Eric and Donald Jr. posed for photographs. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” were also there. Like most aspects of Mr. Trump’s business interests  the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than $500. Mr. Trump’s aides rejected the questions. Mr. Trump returned to New York on Sunday night. But the club will remain an escape for him. His contentious Twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at    compared with when he is isolated inside Trump Tower. Mr. Trump’s combative public persona  —   often on display during his campaign  —   mostly dissolves behind the   walls of his castle. “   is an environment he can control ” said the historian Douglas Brinkley  who last week attended a    lunch with a longtime club member  Chris Ruddy  the chief executive of Newsmax Media. “I watched him hold court  —   he was so comfortable in his own skin  and so relaxed. ” Mr. Ruddy has hosted Mr. Carr and Laura Ingraham  another conservative radio host who supported Mr. Trump  at the club and has introduced Mr. Trump to a range of news media figures  politicians and donors. He described the   as “seeking the   Donald Trump: totally at ease  very positive  very gregarious. ” Mr. Trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club. Over the Thanksgiving holiday  he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint Rudolph W. Giuliani or Mitt Romney as his secretary of state (he ended up picking neither). During this trip  he has heaped praise on his ultimate choice for the job  Rex W. Tillerson  the head of Exxon Mobil. (Mr. Trump has called him “Mr. Exxon. ”) He talks about the work he has done to find a solution for the problems at the Department of Veteran Affairs  which included a recent meeting with a number of executives at   . Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that he intended to make Brian Burns  the businessman son of a confidante of Joseph P. Kennedy  the ambassador to Ireland. Isaac Perlmutter  the reclusive head of Marvel Entertainment  is a    member who helped Mr. Trump put that meeting together. Mr. Trump has also held   with Robert K. Kraft  the owner of the New England Patriots and a club member  and hosted prominent figures like Carlos Slim  the billionaire who is Mexico’s richest man. Mr. Trump his wife  Melania and their    son  Barron  inhabit a residential area of the club. His adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property. Mr. Trump frequently dines on the patio  a central point of action  where at night a singer plays with a small band  sometimes belting out requests from Mr. Trump and other guests. (“My Way ” a song popularized by Frank Sinatra  was one recent choice.) A violinist sometimes moves among tables  plucking tunes like the theme from “Fiddler on the Roof. ” Mr. Trump has given the cadre of White House reporters who now cover him some access to the club  but grudgingly so  —   he once again eluded the reporters covering him on Saturday  slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in Jupiter. And outside the confines of    old grievances flare up. On the golf course  Mr. Trump spotted Harry Hurt  a biographer who wrote critically of Mr. Trump years ago  preparing to play a round with David H. Koch  a billionaire conservative donor. Mr. Trump ordered club officials to remove Mr. Hurt from the property  according to a Facebook post by Mr. Hurt. Over the years  Mr. Trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with Palm Beach officials. He has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over    and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds. With its owner’s coming new job  the club has had some changes. Guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance. Secret Service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property  at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds. Robin Bernstein  a club member for nearly 25 years  said that some club members might express frustration  but that most thought it was important “that we keep Donald and his family safe. ” Attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the   around  and expect it will continue. “The loser in this game is Camp David ” said Mr. Brinkley
